Occasionally you get a guy like this. I was just about finished serving someone when the next person in line to be served (rude man = RM) says, ""do I have to call to get service around here.""

Me: ""I'll be with you in just a second, I'm just finishing with this man.""

RM: says nothing

Me to RM: ""how can I help y-?"" 

RM: ""I need a helmet for my son""

I take him over to the helmets and ask if I could try one on for size so I could let him know which models will fit his son. 

RM: completely ignoring the question, ""what colours does this one come in?"" 

me: I point and explain all the colours and add, "" this also comes in a black which I can order in and a blue which I can get from the ba-”

RM: ""get it""

I get the helmet and show it to him,

RM:  ""the blue one?""

me: ""this is the blue one""

RM: ""you said you were getting the blue one""

Me: ""I've got it right here in my hands""

RM: ""that's aqua. I'll have a black one ordered in""

I can't remember how the dialogue went after this but I had to explain I would have to try one in another colour in his son before we ordered the black one in to make sure it would fit correctly. He didn't like that at all but I mentioned if the son fits another style better then we would likely have the black one in stock and the father changed his tune pretty quickly. We had a sale for these helmets that finished a while ago and he asked if we'd do it for the sale price. Typically we would say yes because there's a lot of room to move with these helmets and we like to make sure people (especially kids) actually have them to wear, so we discount them often - but not this time. Not a chance I was gonna take a cent off the helmet after he acted like that in front of his kid. 

tbh the helmet is more of an aqua colour, but it is definitely darker than your typical aqua. Most of the time I'm showing the helmet to kids and it's so much easier just to tell them it's blue and even kids understand."

As a little backstory, I work in an office supply store in their printing department. We can do all kinds of things from making indoor banners to simply printing a black and white sheet of paper. Our prices are a little high and we have an express fee for doing a job within the hour. Now, onto the story. 

At this point I had been working at the store for nearly a year now and I knew the ins and outs of the printing department. If you have a question, I know the answer. We were getting ready to close up shop, about twenty minutes before close. At this point, a lot of my machines are turned off and a lot of the jobs dropped off are to be completed the next morning. A woman comes in to pick up her order and I happily give it to her. The job hasn’t been completed by me, but by a fellow coworker. I was just handing it off. 

The woman looks at it, confused. She said it was supposed to be mounted, which is laminating it onto a 24x36 foam board. I check her order ticket and, no. There was no instructions for it to be mounted. So I inform her of such and tell her I’ll do it for her and quote her a price. It was definitely expensive so I offered a cheaper option, she can find a foam board and do it herself. She seemed pleased and walked away when I told her where they were. 

Think that’s the end? Oh no. This isn’t a happy ending. After about two minutes, she approaches the front. I was speaking to my manager about something and she asked where they were a second time. I confirm with my manager and point her in that direction. My mistake for not taking her back to look. When she came back up, she was angry. She got in my face to scream, “it’s not back there!”

I have an anxiety disorder and people yelling at me sends my anxiety in a whirlwind. So I got quiet and squeaked out a “Really?” While my coworker checks her out for her other times. My manager and other coworker were standing there while she screamed at me. At some point, my manager left as he didn’t want to deal. I don’t blame him. 

She was saying things like she understood why we had no customers (remember, it’s about ten minutes before close now) and she’d tell all her friends to never come here as our customer service was awful. My heart was racing and I couldn’t catch my breath. As she left, my coworker sarcastically called to her to have a nice day. As soon as she was gone, I broke. I started blubbering like a baby, hyperventilating and trying to hide my face. 

My coworkers were awesome, trying to calm me and make me laugh. The woman eventually got comped for her order and was happy. I, however, will never forget the way she screamed in my face."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dk5wlu/the_great_nightstand_debacle_of_2019/,"The Great Nightstand Debacle of 2019 I work at a home goods store that also sells small furniture. 

It’s Sunday and there is absolutely nobody in the store. My manager and I are bullshitting away while organizing and tagging different product around the store. The phone rings and my manager picks it up. 

Manager: “Thank you for calling (Store) this is (Manager) how can I help you?

After that all hell breaks loose. 

All I here is a very frustrated woman yelling over the phone for a good ten minutes. Apparently she had bought 2 night stands offline and was very upset because one of them was “defected”. One of the legs won’t go in because there are no screw holes. She says that she’s been to two other stores in the area and they just won’t help her. Thankfully my manager is a saint and tries to help her over the phone by asking for the package number, sku code, whatever she can do to see what specific night stand it is and see if we have one in store. We have two! She tells the lady this and they’re actually on final sale because they are an older model. The angry customer says she’ll be right over and the phone call ends. 

We end up forgetting about this whole debacle because we have a small rush. The lady comes in after and is obviously very frustrated. I great her and she huffs and starts her rampage. 

RL: Rude Lady
ME: Me

RL: “This is the third store I’ve been to and I’m very tired. Where’s the night stand? I need to get home.”

ME: “Oh I believe you spoke with my manager, let me go get her!”

I step away and get my manager from the back in a 15 and say the lady is here for the night stand. My manager completely forgot, but thankfully it’s already on the floor so she grabs it to bring over. There was a decorative bowl on the table so when my manager took it off, RL saw this and was very upset. 

RL: “You didn’t even have it out for me? Something was already on top of it?” 

Manager: “Yes man, we want to show different was our furniture can be used”

RL rolls her eyes but still takes a look at it. She also gives the old night stand to my manager and it’s still in the box. While RL is inspecting my manager is assembling the one from the box. 

RL:”I don’t like it, there are scratches all over the top.”

She tries to show me the scratches but there were none there. To play along I just nod and try to problem solve. 

ME:”Oh, yes ma’am that’s very frustrating. I do have a stain stick in the back. Would you like me to fill the scratches right now?”

RL: “No! I want it to be perfect! If I wasn’t concerned with the quality I would’ve picked one off the side of the road.”

I nod slowly. I didn’t see the scratches, and she told my manager earlier that a table cloth and lamp will be covering the top. Even if there was a scratch no one would see it. 

My manager is almost finished assembling the nightstand and we get to the “problem leg”

RL:”See, you can’t fit the screw through the hole. You can’t even sell that! I just want my money back.” 

My manager agrees and they do an online return but then RL wants us to look for a different store in the area with the same nightstand. Again, it’s a final sale item. The item is scared and is an old model. 

Manager finally finds one in the system and calls the store just to make sure. They do but the store is 20 miles away. By now we have 2 hours left for business, and that goes for every store on the east coast. RL finally leaves but grumbles about how she has to make another stop. 

After she’s gone my manager finishes assembling the nightstand. RL didn’t take out the drawer of the nightstand. The screw fits perfectly fine. I looked at the other nightstand in different lights. The “scratches” was the nature grain of the wood."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/djy840/i_was_right_but_still_wrong/,"I was right... but still wrong? I work in a hardware store. We sell thousands of items and it would be almost impossible to know literally every single item we hold. Most of us only know the general aisle it may be in. And we’re a small store compared to those nearby that are almost double the size. 

Onto the story...

Customer came up to me asking for a red carpet runner. We sell carpet runners and there’s one that’s dark red, but it has a design on it and inform the customer as such. She wants a plain one. Tell her the runners are located down the aisle we were infront off so she can have a look because there may be others and if she gets stuck she can ask the person in flooring. She walks away angrily (retail workers can tell) and I watch her find a plain red runner that I didn’t even know existed (score!).

She comes back up the aisle (angrily) towards me and says “You know, you should really be aware of what you sell” 
“... Weren’t the carpet runners down there?”
“Yes they were down there”
“... So I was right?”

She walked away. 


TL;DR Customer found what she was looking for where I told her they were but I should of known what was there."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/djz63m/communication_is_key/,"Communication is key I work for moderately priced furniture chain (not budget but definitely not high end either). Anyway all of our furniture ranges are manufactured in Asia and then shipped to our stores in Australia so as you can imagine delays occur from time to time.

It’s frustrating for both us and the customer but at the end of the day we can’t control international trade.

One of these delays happened over a holiday period which really upset a great deal of customers, most were understanding but some definitely were not.

This woman was one of them, her and her husbands order was due to come in three weeks late and she informed us she would be out of the country and not able to collect for several weeks after it arrived. As it was more or less our problem a delay occurred we advised it would not be a problem. I think it’s important to note her and her husband had been in the store several times over various weeks nailing down exactly what they wanted so all the staff in the store knew them by face and name.

Cut to a few weeks later and she shows up to collect, this is immediately odd as he husband, who by this point we all knew pretty well, had been in a few weeks before and taken their stuff. When we told her this she lost it, basically screaming that we were liars, pointing and throwing her hands all over the place, threatening all kinds of legal nonsense. Apparently we had violated all kinds of consumer laws, the works. 

There were three of us there trying to calm this woman down and we eventually reached the conclusion that perhaps there had been some kind of misunderstanding and that the wrong order had been fulfilled (this is possible as several of the same item were in storage for people). We asked that she call her husband to check it had not been collected by him but she refused saying more or less that we were calling her and her husband liars and she would not be spoken to in that way. Mind you were were completely calm the whole time and not at all suggesting she was lying as it was clear there was some kind of misunderstanding.

Eventually my manager agreed to let her take one of the other units we had out in storage more or less just to get her to leave. Several customers had gathered at the spectacle she was creating. Later when a customer had asked what was wrong she burst out laughing saying “oh was that all that was wrong”

The next day I got a text message from a different manager that her husband had just arrived to return the unit as, surprise surprise, he had collected theirs weeks ago. How he had taken home a large item of furniture without her knowing for several weeks is beyond me.

Apparently when my manager insisted on an apology to us staff members by his wife he refused and she promptly told him that in that case they were no longer welcome in the store.

Moral of the story is maybe occasionally talk to your spouse?"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/djynnj/everyone_included_my_mom_made_fun_of_me/,"Everyone included my mom made fun of me I work in a store that sells music gear and recording equipment. We're not the best, but we're busy and I enjoy talking about the gear that I like. At the time I was working at the front door where I greet guests and check their receipt on the way out since we have a lot of shrinkage. I check every receipt and sometimes make light chit chat if it's an item I know is really cool. This story happened today.

&#x200B;

A customer was leaving and as I checked their reciept I noticed that they bought an interface from a line that I also use (scarlett if anyone is curious). I mentioned how I have a similar model and that they chose something really good and the best bang for your buck unless you wanna spend a grand.

&#x200B;

The guy takes my comment well and asks out of curiosity what the best thing (in my opinion) is. I answer honestly and say the Apollo, which is sick and the new models coming out look beautiful. We're all been practically ogling them at work since we're not allowed to merch them yet. The man leaves after I give my little excited spiel about it.

&#x200B;

He comes back a few minutes later with an envelope and says that he wants me to have it. I've seen seemingly great and charming customers act really fucking weird and not so cool at work, so I leave the envelope alone in the desk and forget about it for a while, thinking the worst. Later, (almost until close) I ask a coworker that is much bigger than me to open it.

&#x200B;

A thousand dollars in cold hard cash was inside. I'm bugging, my coworker is bugging, we act like children who just broke a lamp and pull out manager aside with the most ""confused child"" demeanor you'd've ever seen. 

&#x200B;

My manager looks up the person who left it, since we normally take the name of the guest who makes a purchase and he was the only person to buy that model that day. Boss makes a record of it, and says we have to hold onto it for thirday days.

&#x200B;

Everyone else on the floor hears about it, and just starts railing into me about how I should've kept it. One kid comes upstairs from his department to say I made a bad call, one guy directly pages my line and says I should've kept it, I come home to tell my mom the story and even she said she would've kept it. But like, the vibe on that thing was absolutely rancid, and I had no interest to see where free money would take me. I did fuck all to deserve it. I'm really not looking forward to hearing the day crew give their two cents during my next shift."

Then you obviously know literally nothing about Star Wars. I work at video game store that also sells collectibles like toys, action figures, trading cards, etc.

An older gentleman came in yesterday and started browsing the Star Wards figures that we have.

I walk up to him and say, ""Hi, welcome to Game Store. How can I help you today?""

""Just taking a look at the Star Warts figures you have here.""

""Ah. Are you for a particular character, or just taking a browse?""

He ignores my question and asks, ""Do you know about Star Boards?""

""Well, I haven't seen the latest couple of movies, but I've seen most of the others, and, yeah, I really like them.""

""Oh, well if you haven't seen the latest one then you aren't a fan. You probably don't even know about (character name from the new movie that I forgot, since I indeed did not know about them. Big ****in' surprise).""

At this point I'm annoyed, but I still have my customer service smile.

""Okay, well, if you need anything, let me know; my name's Knever.""

I leave him and he continues browsing.

I go back around the counter and do some clerical work, still annoyed at this guy. It's hard for me to let things go. I know; I'm working on it.

After a few minutes I decide to try to help out some more even though he acted like a prick. I print out a list of upcoming Star Chords figures and bring it out to him.

""Hey, I got you a list of the upcoming Star Lords figures if you were looking to get one coming out soon.""

""Oh, well, if you don't know about Star Chores then how can you sell them?""

This was really out of left field and I didn't quite know how to respond.

""Well, I actually do know some about Star Moors, but even if I didn't, that wouldn't stop me from being able to sell you something from it.""

I was about done with him at this point.

""Let me know if you need anything else,"" I said and left him be. He eventually left without buying anything, and didn't thank me once. Ugh.

I wish I would have been able to have said something snarky like, ""Oh, Star Nords?! What the heck is that?! Yoda?! Vader?! Skywalker?! What's an EWOK?! WHO IS LEIA?! **WHAT THE FORK IS AN AR-TOO-DEE-TOO?!?!?!?!** GRAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAGRBLBRGBLRG?!""

But, customer service.

TL;DR Gatekeeping is ****ing infuriating, especially when I'm doing my best to try to help you."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dj8mxt/the_doctors_have_to_take_my_face_off_because_i/,"""The doctors have to take my face off because I have skin cancer"" First-time poster on this sub. This event happened this past Tuesday and I've been debating on whether or not this was a good enough story to post. I figured someone might get a kick out of it so: here you go.

I work at a big name crafts store as a cashier. It was around mid-afternoon so we weren't particularly busy. Weekdays tend to be very quiet with the only big rushes coming in around 12 or after 3. This elderly lady with frizzy white hair comes walking up to my counter with her items and a coupon. Okay, standard stuff. This should be an easy sale.

So I start scanning her items and while I do that I try to start up a conversation. I like to do that. I find it helps pass the time for the customer, plus I just love to hear other people's stories. Well boy howdy did this woman have a doozy.

I wasn't able to remember the exact dialogue but I remember that this was so sudden I almost got whiplash. I'll give you guys a rough summary of how it went.

Me: So, how have you been doing?

Old Lady: Awful. I'm 91 years old so my health is going.

Me: Oh i'm very sorry to hear that. but wow 91 years old that's impressive.

OL: The doctors- The doctors have to take my face off.

Me: O-Oh?

OL: I have cancer. They have to remove my skin. I have skin cancer and \[name of some other medical ailment that i can't remember.\]

Me: That's awful I'm very sorry to-

OL: It makes my leg shake in the night and look at my hand \*shows me her hand\* It makes it so hard for me- it shakes. And they always say ""oh you look fine"" and ""oh you look great"" but they're lying I know they are.

Me: I'm very sorry to hear that ma'am-

OL: I've always had cancer. I keep telling my doctors. But they never find anything. They say it's not there. BUT I KNOW i have cancer!

Me: \*starting to realize she could be mentally ill\* Ah. I see.

OL: I had a tumor in my lip once. It took them two years to get it out because they didn't believe me. And I had- I had cancer behind my stomach. And then I had a blocked \[unintelligable\] that they had to go through my whole intensities and give me a bag to help drain it and- \*she keeps going on about her entire medical history\*

Me: Right- that will be-

OL: I recently signed over my house to my grandchildren- and they say- they say I-

Me: Ma'am, that'll be \[Total amount of purchase\]

OL: Oh right \*puts her card in the machine\*

We finish up the transaction and I'm certain now she's going to say her goodbyes. But no. After I hand her the receipt she goes right back to talking.

OL: - anyway I've had to get 58 surgeries. Oh and look at this.

Then from the depths of her purse, she pulled out a ziplock bag with papers inside, pulled out the papers to reveal that they're just random blurry photos of random parts of her body. A couple of photos of her face. A few of her hands. A few of her feet. They all looked normal but she's pointing out these photos as if they're PROOF that she has cancer.

I think she felt emboldened to keep going because nobody else was there. So there I stood. Looking at blurry photos. I didn't want to seem insensitive and tell her to get lost, but I didn't want her to hinder me doing my duties. I also wasn't sure if she was mentally ill or not. I'm a very empathetic person, especially when it comes to cancer patients. My grandpa passed away due to liver cancer and losing him was painful. Even so, I know she might have been doing this out of fear, and just needed an outlet.

I took her hand and told her, ""Well, you were strong enough to make it this far and I pray that you'll at least be able to find some comfort.""

She laughed as if I had said a joke and then turned to walk away because she noticed another customer coming up to the registers.

It was a really strange and kind of uncomfortable encounter. I do hope that woman is ok though, despite coming off as a little bit crazy."

It was almost Christmas I think, so obviously very busy. The cashiers had to go to the office if they ran out of change, which on that day was happening quite a bit.
Well needless to say, the cashier ran out of change for this woman who paid with cash, and that gave me enough time to finish bagging groceries as this woman has a lot of groceries.

After like a minute the woman looks at me and asks why the cashier just up and left.

""She's going to get change because she ran out.""

Her face was the description of confusion. It was like she was reacting to me talking about quantum physics. She goes, ""Isn't this store open 24 hours?""

""Yes.""

""Then why is she out of cash.""

I was confused at what she meant. Like did she think we worked constantly and like lived at the store or does she think that the 24 hours automatically regenerates cash instantaneously. I don't know, not really something that frusterated me or was annoying, but just a strange thing."

This happened 3 weeks back now. 

I recently started a job at a bakery where we have $1 cupcakes on Tuesdays. 

Now, people will order them ahead of time, having us set them aside and bag them. They give a pick up time and name, all is good. Not everyone knows about this, but hey, they are a buck, so they do it next time. 

As you can imagine, everyone comes in and gets dozens. This day though, was a day. 

At the time, we had about 10 people in our small storefront. There are usually 3 of us to help customers, so we do our best. I call to help whoever is next, and a woman and her daughter walk up. 

The woman starts telling me her life story, but today they are at our bakery to buy 60 cupcakes for a baby shower on the weekend. Okay, no problem. Did you want to get 5 flavors, a dozen each? She struggled with this idea for bit, but finally agreed. This is where it turns. 

She tells me she wants the prettiest cupcakes since it's for a shower. Okay, the best decorated ones, can do. She picks cookies and cream, and I start to fill a dozen. She stops me, and asks me to PULL THE TRAY out of the case and let her INDIVIDUALLY choose each cupcake for each dozen. Her daughter gets embarrassed instantly. I kind of stared at her for a second til she asked again. As if there weren't 7 people behind her wanting cupcakes as well. So there I am, forced to pull the tray out while she picks 12 cupcakes from throughout the whole tray. People around her are kind of staring, and her daughter had tried to say something but she ignored it. 

It took 15 minutes to get them all. It was insane. My coworker helped her check out and he kind of bluntly told her that she needs to order next time, especially if it's for such an important event like a shower. 

Don't be so sucky and cheap, especially if it's for an event.

Edit: Something I had forgotten about this interaction til the morning was she asked me to get 30 of the leaf rings we had on the funfetti rings because they were ""so cute"" and they all HAD to match. We didn't charge her for them either.

Edit 2: someone kindly pointed out a spelling mistake and then deleted their comment. Thanks???"

I greeted the customer and asked what I can help her with today. 

Lady: It’s what I did for you today.

Lady: I don’t know how a company would sell opened items!

Me: Well, we don’t sell open food containers however we cannot control customers who may have opened the containers.

Lady: I doubt a customer would open these soups and just leave them on the self, you must have taken it back as a return and placed it on the self. \*points to me\*

Lady: What?

Me: When you turn the cap it breaks the inside seal.

Lady: …

Me: So, like I was saying earlier, we can not control customers and do not sell open products. I will take out the broken sealed containers and have the service desk claim then out and I will personally restock the unopened containers back to the sales floor.

My main job used to be on the lumber side (showing people where certain products are, helping them load their purchases and writing receipts for checkout) and this is where today's story is set. Ahem...

It was my second year and a hot summer day. This couple drives to the yard and asks for our cheapest impregnated boards. We were running a promotion on last year's boards (a bit grayed in the sun, nothing major) and this was what they wanted. Being the usual picky customers I was already well used to they wanted to hand pick every single board. Mind you that they were taking enough to build an entire deck so this was a crapload. And by ""hand pick"" I mean they checked every board from every angle so that they were absolutely perfect (yet you came here for the cheapest). After twirling a board for what felt like an eternity they immediately threw it on their trailer. I have no idea how long this took, I zoned out quite fast while standing there waiting for an opportunity to write their receipt. Usually I ask what a customer's quota is and give them their receipt based on that, especially if it's busy so I can move on to other customers, and check their load once they're finished if I can. They ""didn't yet know how many they need"" (people usually do, I have no idea why some feel like making me stand around) and it wasn't terribly busy so I just kinda hung around while they did their thing. They finish up, I thank them for their patronage, give them their receipt and move on with my day.

Now, a couple of days later, word got out that someone had had a complaint made of them but by who, when and where remained a mystery. All we knew was that this person had complained about terrible service and how this salesperson had ""just stood there and not helped with loading their trailer whatsoever"". For a while we thought this salesperson had been one of our younger summer workers. Finally, when we found out who had made the complaint, it clicked and I outed myself as this terrible person ""refusing"" to help. I mean, what was I even supposed to do? Had I put anything in the trailer that they had not approved they would've complained. So, what, they wanted me to rip the boards from their hands and throw them on the trailer before they could? ""Ah yes, you are clearly far to weak and frail to put this board on the trailer that is literally right next to you. Let me.""

Customer service will be the death of me."

Backstory

Hurricane Harvey was devastating to many areas and I , who lives in southern Texas, was somehow only mildly affected.  Other aspects of my life weren't.  I can say the store ,which will call Toad Town Grocery, I worked at was most definitely affected.  Beside the fact that we couldn't get anymore product than what we had left means that when we finally open our doors after closing due to floods, people stormed us.  We were low or out of everything.  You name it milk, bread, water, canned goods, diapers, etc.  One thing that was also affect was people's intelligence.  Due to the panic of all this people couldn't think straight or in this case hear straight.  Since stores were closing early due to the rain still threatening to flood, we were getting phone calls to the store like crazy.  They all asked the same question.  ""Are you open?""  Since we had so many calls coming through it was impossible to answer the phone and work at the same time with lines longer than all tarnation.  My usual greeting over the phone was ""Toad Town Grocery on Mushroom Kingdom St!  This is OP!  How can I help you!"".  But since we had so many calls about the same thing I tacked this on to the phrase and it sped things up.  ""Toad Town Grocery on Mushroom Kingdom St! This is OP!  How can I help you!  And before you ask, we are open 'til eleven.

Here's the story

Remember when I said people ""Due to the panic of all this people couldn't think straight or in this case hear straight?""  I get a call and start my phone greeting.

OP: Toad Town Grocery on Mushroom Kingdom St!!  This Op How can I help you!  And before you ask we are open 'til eleven!

D: YOU GUYS OPEN! (yes she's shouting)

OP: (I pause for a moment) We are open 'til eleven!

Over the summer, I worked at a drugstore out on Long Island. I bike everywhere, and to get to the store, I had to take one of two major roads. One of the roads was bigger and had a faster speed limit, and it makes me uncomfortable to have so many cars whizzing by me. I normally choose the smaller road, which (in theory) has a slower speed limit, but because the road has less traffic, people go at whatever speed they want because the traffic cops mainly stick to the big road. Another obstacle on this smaller road is that it is very close to the beach, so there will often be large patches of sand on the side of the road, which is especially dangerous for cyclists.

I was biking to work one morning and I had to go a bit into the road to avoid one of the patches of sand, and was surprised when I heard a loud car horn right behind me. A split second later, a red minivan whizzed around me, going well above the speed limit. I was annoyed by their lack of decorum, so I theatrically flipped them off with both arms. To my surprise, the car stopped until I came alongside it. Sitting in the driver’s seat was an older man not wearing a shirt. As I passed him he accelerated, trying to run me off the road, coming alongside me and then swerving towards me, while screaming about how he was going to beat me up and kill me. I ignored him as best I could, dodging his car with little difficulty as there was a small grassy incline that I stayed on top of, and he eventually gave up and drove off. I arrived at work with no further incident. I mainly forgot the details of the incident a while later.

A few days after, I was checking out an older gentleman at the store, and we started a small conversation, and it was very nice. I wished him a nice day, and he left. Over the next few weeks, he came in every couple of days to pick up groceries and the like. Each time, we had a small conversation. One day, our conversation drifted over to the roads and traffic, and he mentioned that he always drives on the road that I bike on. I mention that I always use that road to get to work as well, and then I mention that sometimes drivers can be a bit aggressive on that road, mentioning that I had an incident a couple of weeks ago. As I say this and I’m looking at him, something clicks, and I realize that this man who I’ve enjoyed talking to these last few weeks is the SAME GUY who threatened to kill me all those weeks ago. He realizes the same thing, and we stare at each other in silence for a few moments before his transaction goes through and he abruptly leaves the store. I never saw him again."

The cashier tells me that there are two bags of popcorn ringing up incorrectly according to the customer. The bags of popcorn were ringing up as I believe $2.00 but were supposed to be 2 for $3.00, or $1.50 each. I remember something very similar happened a couple days ago, so I give the customer the benefit of the doubt and I immediately change the price without even looking through the weekly flyer or looking at the tags of the shelf.

Despite changing the price of something on the spot with no fucking question (something that could possibly come back to me if I was wrong), this lady was STILL not happy.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/digapa/gotta_love_the_classic_oneliners/,"Gotta' Love the Classic One-Liners... I work in a well known game store and it's the only one in town.  We get a lot of people who try to ""rent"" games from us by buying them, returning them before the seven days for a full cash refund expires, then try to buy back the game they ""Didn't like."" or was the ""Wrong version"" or ""It didn't work!"" just a day or two later.  We got to the point that with these regulars we'll flat out deny having the game they want to buy back to keep them from fucking up our profits/inventory any more than they already are, and we've had regulars come into our store and complain that they went to another store in another city and discovered their account had been frozen/banned for abusing the store policy.  For some reason they think we'll magically be able to free their account or like their account will work in our store for... reasons.

Any rate just the other day a dude tried to return is XB1 controller simply because his son didn't like it.  His son had been playing with for at least a week and since he bought it NEW and then PLAYED with it the controller had officially gone from new to used.  The dude kept insisting that even though it was in fact used he should get a full refund as if it were new because.  ""Well, I come here a lot and I've spent a lot of money here.""

Dude...  EVERYONE comes to this store a lot!  They also spend a lot of money since games, consoles and controllers are expensive!  Why should you be above the return policy?  The controller worked fine and played fine, your brat of a kid just didn't like it for a reason eh couldn't give us.

The manage did take it back but laid it on thick letting him know that he was going to have to defect it out, which means we lost profit and now the whole store is hurting.  He also told him that it was going to be the one and only time, and if he tries it again he'll be barred from the store.

I honestly doubt we can bar him from the store over one controller, but it sounded convincing enough that the dude essentially paled and agreed to not try to do it again.

Seriously though...  Why do people seriously think that their patronage alone is keeping an entire store afloat?  No one is that powerful, and you're NOT special!"

We had one regular “customer”.. you know the ones that come in, waste an hour and buy fuck all.  One of the weeks we had some new limited edition consoles come in brand new, to my surprise they ended up buying one!.  It was spoken about by the staff as they’d never bought anything before and wondered if they’d robbed a bank or pushed over an old lady for her purse.  Couple of days passes before they return to the store carrying a very clearly used console, and I’m guessing this thing has become faulty due to the lack of oxygen in their tobacco fogged home...

The excuse for wanting to return the console.. “when we got home we realised we didn’t have a tv”.. they said they never used it as they couldn’t and wanted a full refund.  🤦‍♂️"

Well, today this woman stops me and gets my attention. I ask her what she needs help with. She explains that she needs 2 bikes and we only have one built and she needs another. So she asks when another can be built. I said it won't be until tomorrow morning because that's when our builders come. My coworker comes up from behind me and verifies this.

She shows us the bike and says, ""It's just a kid's bike. You can build that now really quick, right?""

I explain that it's not up to us. For liability reasons we can't build anything and have to leave it up to our builders.

She explains that she NEEDS it today because her husband ran over her grandkids' bikes and they're coming over later today, so she needs to replace them. I explain again, there is no way that I can build them. Simple or not, if something goes wrong, we can be held liable and I can get in trouble or even fired no matter how good a job I do simply for putting us at risk.

 I got called up to register, had been up there for roughly 30 minutes already. Then this lady and who I assume were her son's came up to my register. They only had a handful of items. As I'm ringing them up and taking off security tags, the lady says she doesn't want one of the soaps she had. Nbd,  I remove the soap and continue with what i was doing. 

Then I hear the lady say that ""he doesn't need it anyway it's only gonna make him break out."" (I figure she's talking about her husband or boyfriend). Then one of her son's say ""what he needs is some soap for his feet. Have you seen them?"". I chuckle a little thinking, ""I feel ya kid my dad has wierd feet too"". The lady then says, and I quote ""it doesn't matter, I suck his toes anyway."" At this point I'm just trying not to break out into laughter.

It was small, and not too busy so shifts would either just be me, or with one other person. This time it was two of us. This guy came in to use our bathroom, but left without getting anything. Not something I was ever bothered by, so I didn’t really think about it. He came back right as we were closing and went back into the bathroom. He came out and kind of frantically asked if we’d taken the trash out. I told him yeah because we’d done just about the entire closing routine at that point. He asked to take me to the dumpster. This guy was pretty big, kind of sketchy looking thug type. He sounded like he was in a hurry too. I’d spent a lot of my youth in the streets doing all sorts of things, some of them questionable. I see a guy like this, and I understand them. He’s just on one of his daily adventures that’s taking him wherever his mishaps lead him. He’s not really thinking, he’s just doing. These sort of people I feel more comfortable around than the other customers who want to come in and talk about the weather. So I take him to our dumpster. I ignore my coworker looking frightened. 

The dumpster is in a garage type room that you need a password to get into, so I was just in there alone with him. I ask him what it looks like he’s looking for, and he said a Swisher wrapper wrapped in a paper towel. In high school we always kept weed in swisher wrappers after using them for blunts, so I asked him if he was looking for weed. He didn’t look at me, and just said yeah real plainly. I immediately knew it wasn’t weed he was looking for, and felt slightly less comfortable. I open the dumpster for him, and literally the entire thing is filled with clear trash bags filled with paper towels. That’s mostly what we threw out on a daily basis, just tons of paper towels because we had to wash our hands after everything we did in front of customers, and in the bathroom all people threw away were paper towels. All I could think was “Good luck finding it,” after seeing what it looked like. He started tearing open the bags, and just going through paper towel after paper towel. He was somehow making a mess in a dumpster. He’d tear open a new trash bag and rummage through each paper towel, and then move to the next one. He was looking for a needle in a haystack. I was going to let him entertain himself for a couple minutes, but I had to get back to closing. Then out of the blue after a good few minutes of nonstop rummaging, he found it. I was actually in disbelief, but I should’ve never doubted that crackhead mentality. I lead him out, and I still to this day am amazed that he walked out of there successful. As we walk out I see my coworker approaching with a phone to her ear looking terrified, and saying she was so worried. I ignore her and watch the man disappear into the night, walking away to another misadventure. And that’s how I helped some guy find drugs out of a dumpster.

As soon as we opened lay-away for the holidays, she would start treating our store like her personal closet, and we were her servants. 

She would come to the counter with a full cart to be put in lay-away, then ask for all the items she put in there already to be brought out and layed across the counter so she could see everything and decide what she wanted to buy that day. 

She came in every single day, accumulating piles and piles of items in lay-away that we would then have to lug in and out every day for her to look over and choose from. She had her own shelf in the back. That's how much stuff she had. 

I was told she could get snippity if a person acted annoyed, but I never got to see it because often I was already busy with another customer when she arrived, so I never got to the point of being annoyed. Just intrigued. 

If there was ever an old lady I wanted to turn into a children's book, it was her."

I work in a hardware store. I was ringing up a father and his child when I go to interact with the kid like I always do. I go to ask him how old he was, and this cute little guy says in the happiest way he could that he was about to be four. This is where dad chimes in and says, “no you’re about to turn three”. Kid I’m pretty sure was just like,”yeah!”. 

The guy behind him said that he was already getting ahead of himself 😂. Honestly it made my day and every time I have a hard day, I think back to that moment. Goes to show that not all retail moments are hard!"

This woman, while leaving the store, sees a friend of hers and stops to chit-chat. Right there in the doorway. I’m helping a customer out to her car, and needless to say the door lady was in the way. The woman I’m helping does not give a single fuck and just pushes her way through, and the door lady moves to the side. Still in the door, but just enough room for me to get through. I go through, and after getting through, door lady slams me in the heel with her cart. I turned back, gave her the stink eye, and go on with my job. The customer I was helping was not very happy with that lady and we both exchanged words about it, she even asked if I was ok. Nice lady.      

I’m headed back into the building when the door lady, who’s roaming the parking lot apparently looking for me, stops me, demands my name, and starts yelling that she’s gonna report me. I must have bumped into her or something and she thought I was purposefully trying to shove her around. She even attempts to bring who I assume is her husband into the fray. I’m trying to keep this from causing a scene and now that I’ve got a burly dude staring at me and a loud, angry woman yelling at me, I’m uncomfortable and immediately suggest we both go inside and talk it out with my manager. This pisses her off even more. We go in, and she starts ranting to the guy at the front desk that I purposefully hit her and her kid. She fully acknowledges that she’s blocking the door but apparently doesn’t see anything wrong with blocking one of our 2 doors because she just HAD to talk to her friend. She’s demanding everything, our store number, corporate’s number, the manager. She’s also pissed off at the lady I was helping. Finally we meet with the manager, she tells her side of the story and storms off. Me and the manager go to the back, and try to review the security cameras (useless, they were too fuzzy to see and one of them wasn’t angled right). Lady comes back in, apparently dragged her kids out of the car, and then says the fattest lie I’ve ever heard a customer say: she claims I was smirking at her when I suggested we talk with the manager. All the while the poor kids look like they just want to go home. So I had to write up a report, some poor corporate phone guy is gonna get an earful, and half an hour has been wasted.     

An hour later, another pissed off person is here, cursing out our entire pharmacy while they threaten to call the cops. No idea what that was about, but everyone noticed it. Luckily he left, and he’ll probably end up banned from the store. Weird day."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dhoh5a/vague_threat_over_040/,"Vague threat over £0.40 This story occurred last night.

So I had been put onto the late shift (3pm-11pm) to cover for a shift manager being away to celebrate his birthday, 

The shift was going really well up until this one incident around 8:30. This man and his kid come up to the till to buy some general bits. As I finish scanning everything, he says “Mate, that price isn’t right, I want to see a receipt”. I then inform him that to see a receipt he first needs to pay for the goods. This is around the time I first started to sense something was up.

He then reluctantly paid for his items and grabbed the receipt off of me. He intensely stared at it before saying “Mate that sausage roll ain’t £1.40, the label says a £1”, “I ain’t paying an extra 40p for that”. He then says “I had to check the receipt as this happens all the time here” which it does since we can’t always update a label as soon as a price changes.

He then delivers the line that genuinely struck a bit of fear into me, “Mate I’ve been arrested before over an incident like this”. My brain starts thinking “What on Earth do you mean by that?” so to avoid a potential incident with him, I went over to check the label myself which indeed did say it was £1 so I gave a refund and put it through at the new price. He then went on his merry way, leaving me confused and to be honest, a little bit worried.

Speaking to my shift manager afterwards, he said he saw them down the isle he was tidying up and got weird vibes about them, but weirdly, more about the kid than the dad."

I'll kick it off with the time a couple came into our store and filled a 4-drawer plastic shelf (around $7) with all these items from around the store. They cut off the spider-wrap from a lot of our high priced tech items, filled baskets full of hard drives, paints, headphones, etc but did this all pretty discreetly. It was clearly an organised operation. 

When we scan the bigger items (like the shelf) we don't usually lift it onto the counter, just lean over and scan so it would have been impossible for the employee checking out to notice the hidden stock.  Luckily one of the employees caught on and upon discovering the couples' shelf filled to the brim with all their loot, the duo got spooked and left the store. After watching the whole thing on the security tapes, we were curious to see how much they intended to steal and rang up around $2300 of tech items and stationary. We've printed out a pic of them in a heart and it's currently stuck under our counters so that we may never forget these bold souls. I mean I can laugh about it now, but if they truly did get away with it, it would have been real bad..."

He goes to help out a customer while I check someone out (cash register) and after I'm done K1 and K2 walk up to me asking me if I've seen their mom, I asked them to describe her so they do and then she appears behind them, they walk away a few feet and I think nothing of it, then she asks if she can use the bathroom after she asks K1 ""really K1, again? You just went""

I know the struggle with my own little brother so I say yes, but by this time Tom comes back and he says it's not a public bathroom, but because I already said yes to show them the way, I brush this off as my mistake as the bathroom is really close to the back room and I've should have known it was not public, but I used it before even before I was an employee. I took K1, K2, and CW1 to the bathroom, then CW2 came along I thought nothing of it maybe she was worried about that she couldn't find them.

Then after I leave a few minutes the bathroom area after all of them leave the bathroom area. Tom calls me over and tells me he's suspicious of them so he's going to watch them and I'm going to cover the registers. He comes back over to the cash registers and looks at the cameras and it confirmed that they were stealing inventory, but Tom deterred them and they left empty handed.

So recently last Saturday i was stocking the batories when suddenly a kid on a bike was riding through the shop. He was weaving left and right through the customers. I tried yelling sbout how dangerous (saturdays are our most busy so it is pretty crowded) it is but the kid wouldnt listen.

I went to talk with a superviser and she said that the kid has beendoing that other times before. It makes me mad thinking how stupid he is. I'm hoping to find a way to desl with the kid when I next come in."

1.)  Me, M1=Manager, M2= the more experienced manager, L=Lady

Customer needs to return a shirt she ordered, washed once, developed a large hole on the seam (yes, I know it happens esp. with this fabric).  She keeps talking.... I mean, TALKING, and talking.  100 words for every 2 necessary and asking if I'm putting this back on her card so she can reorder.  I keep telling her yes.  I tell her everything before, and as I'm doing it.  We get to this point:

<Her store card is declined for insufficient funds> 

L:  Oh, I was afraid that would happen!  I knew I was near the limit.  Can you reverse the return?

Me: I've never heard of such a thing.  I'll get M1.

M1:  Ummmmmmmmmmmm.........

L:  Just get M2, I know she's done it for me before.

30 minutes on the phone to get it reversed, they up her credit limit a bit, reorders the shirt, and she leaves with this weird look on her face.  She did not (for some reason) bring any other cards with her.  I asked M2 later why they not only did that once for her, but why they kept doing it if she couldn't keep her head straight and pay off the bill, or bring her cards with her.  Of course, she's been a long time customer and buys a lot, blah blah blah.  Great start to my very long shift!

2.)  Just Me and CL= crabby lady

We get to the register, and I ask CL for her rewards telephone number.  She gives it to me, I pull up the account, and ask her to verify the info is correct (she can see it on her screen).

CL:  That's the wrong email.

Me:  Ok, hit no and I can update it.  (it's her first and last name at [yadayada.com](https://yadayada.com))

CL:  YOU SPELLED MY NAME WRONG IN THE EMAIL ADDRESS!  (heavy sigh)

Me:  I spelled it the way your name is shown as first and last in the first part of the account.  How is it supposed to be spelled?

CL:  (tells me).

Me:  Ok, verify it's correct again.

CL  YESSSSSSS (mumbles about me spelling the name wrong).

She's had this account a few months and never noticed 2 extra letters and the wrong email.  Now it's somehow my fault.

3.)  At this point, it's the peak late afternoon rush.  We have me, the other two managers, and about 30 customers.  There is a woman there with her grandmother whose about 70.  The girl was delightful and was patient, calm, with it.  The grandmother however, good grief Charlie Brown.

Me, L-lady, M1, M2

L:  So, I need some underwear for a gift.  Which ones are on sale?

(4 tables, all together, all signed with big red simple signs)

Me:  All 4 tables, these 3 are x for $xx mix and match.  This table is 4 for $xx.

L:  Ok, I don't want to get cotton.

Me:  Alright, then you'll be looking at this table.

L:  How much are they?  (looking at the sign)

Me:  They're x for $xx.

L:  Which ones are hipsters?

I showed her the two small sections which are a different feel, but kinda the same.

Meanwhile, I have two people hanging out of the dressing room asking for my help.  I leave to see what they need.  I come back a few minutes later on my way to pull something for one of them.  L drags me back in.

L:  Ok, so which ones are hipsters?  These?

Me:  (Showing her the two again, and where to find the style on the tag).

L:  And what's the sale again?

Me:  x for $xx, these 3 tables.

L:  Which ones were cotton?

Me:  This table.

L:  I don't want cotton.

Me:  (Sighs and scratches my head).

I'm very busy trying to get the item back to the customer in the fitting room.  I get back to the register and turn around to see she's been following me to ask more questions.  I'm trying to ring people up, and she just wonders back to the table, looks at the panties, the sign again, then looks up lost.  This is in the span now of 15 minutes.  She goes into the dressing room with her granddaughter.  I don't see her for another 20 minutes.  Things are still crazy when I'm helping 2 more customers each with a bra.  L comes up asking the same questions and wants me to help pick her out 2 more.  I tell her it'll be a minute because I'm with 2 people in this section.  Wonders back again, circles the table, picks up random pairs, then asks me again where the hipsters were.  I finally just pull two pairs, ask her if she likes the color, and end the misery.  

Her granddaughter checks out with everything, and they leave.  When everyone is gone, M2 tells us L had her trying to fit a bra.  L was fussing about everything, didn't like wearing her size, and so on.  I tell them about the panty debacle, and the looks on their faces were unbelievable."

So due to renovations at my job, our photocopier has been down. There are two sides to the story - one side claims the cables were clipped during the renovation and the internet company cannot do anything; the other claims that the connection is intact but not working and the cables are fine. It's basically a back and forth about who is responsible.

Someone came up recently and asked when it would be available. I told them the above situation in a summarized form. I finished my statement with ""Unfortunately, with the issue with the internet company we do not have an estimate on when it'll be available again.""

The person then looked at me and went, ""Okay, so when will it be ready?"" Bruh... really? I just told you. It's annoying of how people don't listen nowadays and just hear what they want to hear.

I cannot think of any reason I would ever dispute $2.10 cents. Even if I'm right and don't have to pay it, I'm still paying it because it's TWO dollars and 10 F\*\*KING cents.)"

I walk over to her and instinctively reach for the socks to scan them because they had a Clearance sticker and I didn't see any receipts. She immediately swipes the socks and in a confronting manner says ""Can I help you?"" 

I'm confused and shocked, but thinks she speaks a foreign language (we have a lot of people from outside the US who have trouble speaking English that come to our store) and ask politely ""Yeah, can I help you? I saw the socks and was getting to ring it out."" 

Turns out, she was mad because she wasn't buying the socks and apparently they were already bought. I apologized for acting on instinct, but she didn't forgive me. Usually customers understand and will reply ""Oh, I've already purchased this, sorry about that"" and both them and I will move on to what they need to have done. 

She wanted to pay her credit card balance, and I try to maintain my happy, polite composure to help her. I have her swipe her card so we can pay it off. I proceed to ask her ""How much are you wanting to pay off?"" Which I usually ask, because I understand for some customers, especially those with larger balances, that paying it entirely off can be a hard to pill swallow and prefer manageable increments a month until they fully pay off their debt. However, she is baffled by this and tells me she doesn't want me serving her anymore and asks for my coworker to check her out. 

For the next hour or so, I'm just shook by the whole experience. Literally, my body was shaking whenever I helped out the customers who came after her. I think the people noticed the pity in my eyes and treated me better. Luckily, all of my customers for the rest of the day were super nice and awesome even though they didn't see the incident which made me smile and restored some of my faith in humanity."

I've been reading your tales for a bit now and finally have the umph I need to start sharing my stories. First one is sort of amusing. So here it goes.

A lady came in one day to shop for an upright freezer and was heading towards the back to our appliance section. We have a smaller store so there are maybe 4 of us working there at most, each of us covering all sections as needed. Now, oddly enough my main position there is as the lone sales rep for our small section for cellular mobilty sales and rate plans, while helping customers in the other areas when I'm not busy. I didn't have any customers in my section so went to see if I could help this lady as everyone else was busy. 

I approached her with my warmest smile and asked if I could help her out with anything. She explained to me that she was looking for a deep freezer. I ask alot of questions. Not just to make sure I get a good idea of what the customer needs in terms of space, functionality, features, etc., but also out of interest and to build rapport. After a few questions we had narrowed it down to an upright freezer style. Cool! Alright, next is to determine the capacity she needs. 

The conversation continues something like this: 

Me: Alright, so as far as upright freezers go, there are a few sizes (cubic foot capacity) available. Tell me, what do you plan on storing in there regularly?

Customer: Excuse me?

Me: I'd like to know what you plan to use it for?

Customer: (*frowny, puzzled face look*)  Is that any of your business? 

Me: (*confused af, similar expression to match painted on my face*) Sorry?

Customer: Why do you need to know what I'm going to put in there? 

Me: (*lightbulb moment*) Oohhh, I only ask that to get an idea of the size of freezer that would best match your needs. 

Customer: (*less frowny face, still sour*) Oh ok. 

By this time, my awesome lady colleague noticed I was distressed and came over to help. I gently passed her the reins with a smile of gratitude and immediately walked back to my desk in a complete state of confusion. 

Thinking about this afterwards, I think I may be better off not knowing her answer to my question.

Thanks for sticking through to the end guys, hope you enjoyed!

TL;DR Lady comes in to buy deep freeze. I get aroune to asking her what she was planning on storing in it (to get an idea of what size she needs). She gets defensive and asks why that is any of my business. I walk away after colleague takes over. Decided that maybe it was better not knowing her answer to my question?"

He says, ""No, I need it to make ice cream.""

Me: ""Oh, that's down the baking aisle, next to the sugar and flour.""

He waves me off and just casually says, ""Thanks, I just want to take a look,"" and goes off *in the direction of the outdoor salt.* 

Later on, I was busy dealing with someone else's cart, so I didn't notice the same guy go through the self checkout, but he stops by after he finishes and says, ""Thank you, I got everything I needed."" 

I meekly say ""You're welcome"" and proceed to watch him go out the door, trying my hardest to see any sliver of what he actually bought, if he actually bought outdoor rock salt or not, but I couldn't see. I pulled my supervisor aside and explained to him what just happened, and I'm freaking out. 

I'll update this if I hear anything about a guy getting sick from ice cream. But I don't know if that's actually going to be a thing, lol

Edit: To clear up any misconceptions, I know that you use rock salt to make ice cream, the point in me telling this story was because the guy was implying that he wanted the wrong kind of rock salt for his ice cream."

We knew all our customers as homebrew was a niche buisness, It didn't often attract new trade. Dad was doing some accounting work in the kitchen behind a closed door and I was in the shop, sitting on the chair at the sales desk. A regular customer came in and we were talking for a few minutes. Another man on his own came into the shop and was looking around for a minute. Then he came over to me, had 2 of the most expensive wine kits in his hands, excused himself, and asked  could he push past the other man as he was rushing. The other customer said OK. The guy put the two wine kits on the counter and told me he'd bought them from me a couple of days ago. That rang alarm bells as I didn't recognise him as having been in the shop a few days before, never mind buying anything from me . he added  his wife prefared red wine and he had 2 white wine kits. I offered him an exchange but he wanted a refund. I told him I would have to get my dad as I'm not able to give money back. I went into the kitchen and called dad out. He looked round the shop and smiled at the customer looking for a refund. The customer explained himself again and dad said I'm sorry I can't give refunds without a receipt. The man got very flustered searched his pockets and then he said it might be in his car. He left the shop and left the kits on the counter. Never came back. I asked dad what happened. Dad told me look at the shelf. There were 2 gaps where those wine kits on the counter belonged. My dad was a stickler for keeping the shelves full and had just filled them prior to starting  his accounting work and no customers had come in between dad filling the shelf and the regular customer and the con man did. What we knew happened was the guy saw that I was engaged with the regular customer i was talking to and used him as a distraction so he could get the kits off the shelf and bring them over to the sales desk. I hasten to add the regular customer was a customer of ours for some years and well known to both dad and me. He was not a knowing part of the con.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dgwoqi/little_girl_gets_caught_stealing/,"Little Girl Gets Caught Stealing Okay this happened yesterday and I thought I’d share the story. It’s not too exciting but it’s the first time I witnessed something like this. 

A little background: I work at a crafts store as a cashier. I started about a month ago and have been only working two-three shifts in a week. Near the cash registers are aisles where we keep magazines, bags of candy, and some colorful kids toys (small stuffed animals, squishy toys, keychains, etc). It’s not uncommon for me to see little kids begging their parents for a treat of some kind or coming up to the counter with one. 

So yesterday I am working at the register at Guest Services counter cashing people out. In line comes two mothers who both speak Spanish to each other and to the four little girls they had with them. The little girls were running around and begging their moms to get them some small toys. The moms were very assertive and gave them firm ‘no’s’ the entire time they were being cashed out. I felt kind of bad for the little girls, but I understood why the moms were so insistent on saying no. These two women were spending over $200, mostly on ribbon! Not to mention that these little girls weren’t behaving very well, running around in circles and whining (I understand little kids are impatient and it was after 7:30 so I can imagine everyone was just tired, too). 

I get the two moms checked out, and they gather the little girls, all with pouty faces, to leave. I’m handing one of the moms the $200 worth of items while the other mom gets down to the level of one of the little girls who was standing behind her. This mom noticed before I did that the girl had a hand up her shirt. She gets to her level and pulls her arm out, revealing a squishy unicorn keychain! The mom puts the unicorn on the counter near her and scolds her daughter in Spanish. I don’t know much Spanish, but I recognized the word ‘policia,’ which was enough for me to understand that she was basically telling her daughter that she’d get in trouble with the police if she stole. 

I applaud that mom for catching her daughter because I probably wouldn’t have noticed at all!"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dh68ha/your_having_a_bad_day/,"""Your having a bad day"" Another tale from a craft store, seems to be a theme this weekend. 

This happened yesterday, I'm still perturb by it. I just walked in, I'm at my locker getting my things. This lady and her child ask from the end of the hallway, ""can I ask you a question?"" I let her know im not clocked in yet.  ""Oh it's not about a product"" i wanted to say well I'm still not clocked in and I'm not being payed for this. She asked ""where is the bathroom"" since it's in the same hallway as the lockers and my locker is really close to the bathroom area I just point and say it's right there.

So I close my locker and go into the break room and clock in. I get told do some reshop and that's all I had for my tasks. I get started on that and as I'm putting something back on the shelf, I run into her again. She asked ""do we have a price checker."" We do and it's literally right behind her. I tell her ""yup we have 2 one if them is right behind you"" and I point again. She doesn't turn around and asked again. At this point I just didn't understand why she didn't listen to me. So I repeated myself and pointed again. 

She then said ""you're having bad day."" Not as a question, as a statement. I guess the look on my face on that statement showed some frustration.

I was thinking fluff you betch, stfu gtfo, you didn't leave well enough alone, you kept pushing my buttons. 

So I'm called up to the registers, I'm ringing and I  eventually see her line. The line moves and I have a customer with a medium size purchase about 10 items and she is next. I purposely take my sweet time, run through every spiel, ask about the customers project and have some chit chat, just so I don't have to interact with that lady again. Which worked, my coworker who was our main cashier, ended up taking care of her and checking her out. As she was grabbing her last bag I overhear her tell her daughter see this one too is having a bad day. 

So it was either both of us having a bad day or the little girl having a bad day and the mom was trying to show everyone has bad days. I don't know, it just made me frustrated for a bit. I hope everyone has a great day!!

So, I work in a bookshop and this actually happened in front of me between two customers. One I was just finished ringing up, the other was waiting in line.

The woman I just finished was actually happy with having found what she liked for and super friendly. I did everything as usual, she paid and was just putting her wallet back into her bag. On her arm was a leash and her dog was standing next to her.

Queue the other customer pushing past her to pay for her stuff and handing it to me. Nothing unusual, we don't have a belt so customers can't just place stuff down while someone else is still being checked out.

Well, I take the stuff, greet her like usual, start scanning her things. The other customer is just closing her bag when the new one snaps at her.

""You should keep a safety distance."" directed at the nice customer's dog.
Keep in mind, she stepped close to the dog. She was the one not keeping her distance.

Well, the other lady had none of that. She snapped back and told that woman off and a small... Let's call it"" discussion"" ensued between them. Until the nice lady took her cute little POMERIAN and walked out.

The other lady now was rude to me. She didn't greet me, didn't say anything at all. I just did my usual stuff, not caring. It was late and she really was not a friendly person. Once she had paid my coworkers came over and asked wtf just happened.

Well, I still don't know. I only know that customers basically got into a fight over one moving close to a fricking pomerian and then telling the owner, who she moved close to, to keep her distance because of her oh so dangerous dog.

Mind you, that dog was adorable and even I, with a very bad phobia of dogs, was not bothered by it because she was watching it carefully and it was well trained and behaved."

So, this is a story from my neighbor/friend. They work in a feed store, which sells a variety of hay, horse supplies, cooking grills, dog food, cat food, a bunch of other animal food, and much more. It is in the middle of nowhere (not near any tourist attractions, and nowhere you’d go for fun). It’s the type of place where it’s regulars only who come in, and put things on their tab.

Well one day, this Northern European (Norway, Sweden, Finland...) family walks into the tiny store. They spoke perfect English, but mainly their respective language. They were also dressed up in full “cowboy” garb. Hats, vests, jeans, chaps, leather fringe, boots, and even spurs. 

Nobody really dresses like that.

It was such a strange thing. They just walked around the store talking amongst themselves. Of course, they were totally respectful and nice (everybody from Northern Europe is, right???). They left after buying a few random things from the random selection of goods. 

I don’t know why showed up, or why they were dressed the way they were. My best guess is that they were vacationing around America, and wanted the full experience..? Either way, great for them, and it was hilarious. Not all retail stories are awful! I’d also like to hear what other ideas there are as to why they came.

AC: angry customer 

AC: “EXCUSE ME, where is the queue” 

Me: you can queue up at the end, both of these tills are open 

AC then walks around the back of my till and to the side where the items go after the are scanned, and hands me an item, which I scan anyway as the other customers were being served at the next till, without speaking 

AC: SMILE, SMILE, you could be on camera

I ignore her to scan the item and she repeats this again in my face, while I’m feeling uncomfortable and already not in a good mood

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dh5afr/the_embodiment_of_a_tin_foil_hat/,"The embodiment of a tin foil hat Hi, 

so to get started I work at a phone store that sells phones along with cell service, I get this guy who comes from another one of our store locations breathing heavy while standing right behind the counter with me, he went on to explaining to me how it doesn't make sense that he would have to come to this store to get served (Side note with this store if you're going to exchange within the allowable period you go to the store you got it from)  I proceed to explain this to him without getting anywhere.  After he had further explained the situation to me that his phone had been hacked, he can't get into it, and now he's going to switch all of his banking cards based off this assumption, I told him that ""there is nothing to be worried about you probably did something without knowing any better that locked your phone"" to which he kind've gave me a (Do you really think i'm that dumb look).  After assessing the phone and the story he told me, I went to go in the back room with his phone to plug into one of our computers that we do troubleshooting on, I also just didn't want this guy breathing down my neck for any longer.  As I went to go into the backroom he immediately started to question me about what I was doing and when I told him that I was simply going to plug his phone into one of our troubleshooting computers he began to get restless, telling me to stay where he his so that he can ""F\*\*\*ing see"" what I was going to do.  Unfortunately for him i'm not all that kind when disrespected even if it could mean my job, and thankfully for me my manager almost always backs me up in these situations as he's dealt with many more of these types of people.  After he says this I immediately tell him that ""Sir if you want my help i'll give it to you, i'm payed to do it, but if you want to continue with that crap i'll personally walk you out the door, I don't care if you feel that i'm here to take that type of crap because i'm not""  He then went silent for a couple of seconds and told me to go back and do what i've got to do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After about 10 minutes of looking at the phone I see no way of fixing it, I guess he really screwed his phone over but i'm still not convinced it's been hacked, probably a dud.  So as i'm walking back out to where he is I check the safes to see if we have the same phone for him that we can exchange and of course we wouldn't.  With what I know now I speak with him giving him the rundown ""We don't have this phone in stock right now sir, we'll have to order one in for you and exchange it than, in the meantime you can borrow a loaner of ours""  He seems satisfied and apologizes for his actions earlier to which I said that it was fine, we get it all the time but it doesn't help either one of us when someone's going off there head. 

&#x200B;

It's been two months now every thing has been exchanged, he's been called with no response hanging onto our loaner phone that is 4 years older than the new one he had bought, I guess he doesn't care to much for his new phone.   All I can say is that I feel for all of you out there who currently work for retail and have to deal with this on a regular basis.  These types of customers always grind my gears, honestly makes me believe that they've never had to work a job dealing with the public on a regular basis or they just forget how to be human."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dh0p2x/lady_thats_not_how_that_works/,"Lady that’s not how that works Background: I work at a craft store. We allow people to order things online and ship them to the store and they don’t have to pay for shipping. The sales online are often different than the ones online and because of this we can’t price match with our website. The online prices are usually cheaper because they usually take shipping into account. 

This woman came up and while I was ringing her up asked me if we price match with our website. I told her no and before I could explain she just yelled “STOP.” 

I wasn’t dealing with this so I called my manager

Long story short, the items she wanted were $5 cheaper online but had a buy 3 get 2 free sale in the store. She wanted the b3g2 deal for the online price. My manager noticed she was looking at a completely different product online than what she had in front of her and went to go retrieve the correct one. 

When she came back with the right product the lady started going off about how my manager said she was going to honor the online price which never happened, but my manager is nice so she did. I overheard this lady going off again because she didn’t factor in tax and was telling my manager she did something wrong because it was too much now. 

As it turns out the CORRECT item she was looking at was only $2 more expensive than the online price. After the whole transaction she looked at me and told me it was ridiculous that I didn’t adjust the price and that I gave her bad customer service that she’s be reporting. 
 
It would be interesting if she did considering I handed in my two week notice today. 

Tl;dr: Customer wanted the online price for an item for the in store deal. Store doesn’t allow price matching between the two because of different deals that goes on. Told me I have her bad customer service for not adjusting the price and would be reporting me."

Some backstory: I work at a craft store. Some brands (Circuit, LEGO etc.)  will not allow coupons on their items. This is not something my store/manager is able to over ride. Our registers will not do it.  This woman brings up one Circuit vinyl and one of our store’s brand vinyl. The circuit’s are on a buy 2 get 1 free deal whereas the the store brand are 60% off today. Neither of those will allow a 50% off a regular price item to be used on them. 

Cast: Me:me.  DL: deaf lady H: husband  

DL: *lays down vinyls and shows me a 50% off a regular price competitor coupon* 

Me: oh sorry. Coupons don’t work on circuit products and the other vinyl is on sale. There’s a 20% off your total purchase coupon you can use for the store brand vinyl though 

DL: *signs to her husband with an angry face* 

H:*translate what I said* She said that she should be able to use the 50% coupon 

Me: coupons don’t work on circuit products and the other item is on sale so I can’t use that coupon. There’s a 20% off we can use. 

H:*translates  then sighs* 

DL: *pulls up app and goes straight to 40% off a regular priced item*

DL: *aggressively scrolling back to 40% off coupon and signing to her husband* 

H: *signs back and mouths that she doesn’t have a regular priced item* 

DL: *aggressively points to circuit vinyl causing both me and the husband to explain again.* 

She finally lets me scan the 20% off coupon, after seeing it only took 88 cents off (because the store brand vinyl was only $4 after the sale) pauses and get angry and starts signing again. 

H: She says she could go to Competitor store and use the 50% off coupon 

Me: ...okay so she doesn’t want them? *getting ready to cancel the transaction cause at this point I have a line* 

She pauses for 30 seconds just staring a the pin pad then signs back at him and huffs at me.

H: So you don’t want her business

Me: :)

After another brief moment she groans and pays then leaves, aggressively reading the receipt. 

TL;DR: Deaf woman came in my line with husband. She wanted to buy items that she couldn’t use a coupon on. She didn’t get enough off with the coupon she could use and tried to haggle me into giving her more off by telling me she was going to a competitor store. Her total came to $16."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dgyi11/rude_lady_refuses_to_speak_in_language_we_both/,"Rude Lady Refuses to Speak in Language We Both Know I moved to a region recently where there are two official languages. I only speak one of them, but that's generally enough to get by as everyone else speaks the other too. Catalan, the language I don't know, is only spoken here on this region and nowhere else in the world (except Andorra).

So on my previous job in a big clothes department store, this lady came up to me and started talking to me in the other, less-common language that I don't speak. I politely reply in Spanish, as I understand a little bit of Catalan and can sort of hold a conversation like this. Even though I'm from Latin America and my accent clearly shows it (that is, it's obvious by my way of speaking that I'm foreign), this lady insists on speaking in Catalan, which is fine, a lot of people do that here because they have this intense sense of patriotism and I guess they do it as a way to force people to learn their native language. My family's all from here so I sort of get it and just go along with it. However, by the time this happened I had just arrived to the region a few months ago and I couldn't understand Catalan completely if spoken fast, and I had to ask this lady to repeat herself a couple of times. She has been incredibly rude and mean the whole time, almost yelling at me and treating me like a slave, making me show her random items that her son would like and dismissing them saying ""he wouldn't like that!"" like if I knew her son and would know what he wants, until we finally go to check out and she says something else to me. As usual throughout this painful interaction, I had to ask her to repeat herself because she keeps speaking in Catalan even though I haven't replied in Catalan once and she finally snaps and yells at me ""SHOULD I SPEAK IN SPANISH OR CATALAN?! DON'T MAKE ME WASTE MY TIME"", and I just stared at her blankly and say: ""Spanish, ma'am. I thought that was obvious"".

The lady left with her stupid son's present and I've hated her for the rest of my life.

Just in case anyone's wondering why I didn't ask her from the beginning to speak in Spanish: People here usually automatically switch to Spanish when they notice you're foreign, but there's also this complicated political situation where many Catalonians hate Spanish and Spain in general, so since I'm the newcomer here, it makes me scared to spark a political debate or make people upset, and working in retail, you don't have much power to go against the customers, so I just tried to accommodate to people like these in the best way I could."

I was working close to the till, to ring up the occasional customer. I did it as fast as I could, cause I really wanted to be able to finish before my weekend.


On this pallet was a big rack for displaying the books, and it came in a large cardboard box, that I had cut open in the front and pulled the rack out.


A man and his kid (5ish years maybe) came up to pay. The man had a few things for his job, and the kid had an activity book from last season. The man brought me in to their chat about doing a few of the pages in the book, so I opened it and said ""Oooh, look, bats!""


The kid was a little bit shy, so he escaped the conversation while his dad was paying. I kept my eye on him, as all my stuff made a slightly risky environment, and naturally he did what every kid would do. So when payment was done, I said to the dad: ""Your kid disappeared into that big box. I'm done with it, so if you want a huge box to play with during the weekend, feel free to grab it."" 


And they took it! They were so happy, though the kid was still too shy to thank me. I was equally happy, because I no longer needed to struggle with throwing away the huge box. A win-win, and a nice end to the week."

The customer is doing a smug lean on the counter, which gives off a bad vibe, but I don't say anything about it. Leaning customer (LC) explains to me that he bought two pairs of reading glasses, but one of them is missing a nose pad, and is therefore impossible to wear. He wants to exchange the broken pair for a new pair. Seems routine, until I see his receipt. He bought the readers as part of a special, BOGO free (One pair billed at $19.99, one billed at $17.99, with the cheaper one free). Unless I ring in both pairs of glasses as a return, they're going to come up free.

Me: ""Sir, you bought these as part of a BOGO free special, I can't give you anything unless you return both""

LC: ""You don't understand, I want to exchange the broken pair for this ($21.99) pair, I'll even give you the difference between that ($17.99) pair and the ($21.99) pair.""

Me: ""We have eyeglass repair kits which include spare nose pieces."" (I say this because it would have been the cost of ""the difference"")

LC: ""I don't see why I would buy one of those when I can just return the broken pair and get a new pair""

Me: ""Sir, you didn't get the broken pair for $17.99, you got it for free. The only way I can do an exchange is if you return both pairs, then I can give the ($21.99) pair for the difference.""

LC then gets flustered and tries to convince me. I think he thought he could bend the rules since one pair was broken, but I continue to explain that the only way he can do an exchange is if he returns both pairs.

LC: ""Fine then, I'll return both, and I'm not gonna buy anything!""

The return then processes as normal and he gives me both pairs of readers. I don't know if he thought I was stupid, would cave, or possibly both. Either way, I'm not going to risk my job over a pair of readers. I asked my store manager about it the next day, and she told me I made the right call.

C- SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CARRY THIS TO MY CAR???

C then started going on about how we have such bad customer service and that we should be providing plastic bags for free, then just ends up carrying the tray WITH HER HANDS back to the car that was parked 2 meters from our shop. 

&#x200B;

\#2 we have a self serve ""salted brisket"" station thing where you could take a BB and tongs and pick out which pieces you wanted from a large container and have it weighed up at the counter. 

sometimes people bring up their BB full to the brim, hands wet, meat dripping, pay and leave -no complaints at all, sometimes take a box, which is fine but I have customers that take only 1 or 2 pieces and demand an extra bag even tho its obvious that there's no dripping. 

I offer them a free box or a reusable bag for $1 but no. they want a PLASTIC bag. I say no sorry I don't have any (I really don't) the prime minister banned them and we could get fined if we gave out plastic carry bags. 

a customer literally said ""fuck the prime minister"" and I was honestly baffled.

\#3 someone once brought up their BB of brisket and asked for an extra BB which I was told to charge extra 20c for by my boss and so I told the customer that and they got angry and said

C- what??

ME- the extra BB is 20c because you really don't NEED it and we're trying to cut down the use of plastic but we have free boxes or $1 reusable bags if you want

C- NO, I have heaps of boxes and reusable bags at home. they're such a waste of space. I don't want them.  
you know what? I don't want this meat anymore if I have to pay for a BB

and just storms out of the shop. 

I really don't understand the gall of these people. you have heaps of REUSABLE bags and boxes at home but refuse to bring them with you shopping? my parents have a few boxes in the car boot all the time, it shouldn't be that hard to reuse your reusable bags and boxes. if you just leave them to sit at home that just defeats the point of having them.

I laughed and said no, then he asked me for my number... I said, ""haha, no"" 

 I took him to the aisle where the product was located, and he asked me again for my number. I said no, then he said, ""the pocket knife then?"" I responded *no* again, he told me I had to give him something. I just responded that the item he was looking for is all he's getting and walked away.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dg214n/crazy_lady_tries_to_steal_an_xbox_before_the/,"CRAZY LADY TRIES TO STEAL AN XBOX BEFORE THE STORE OPENS I work as a warehouse stock person in an electronics store. Basically, I go around to every shelf in the departments and make sure the products are in the place they should be. It's a pretty easy gig, especially since I clock-in and clock-out before the store opens, so I NEVER interact with customers...until today.

It was a pretty typical morning of checking off the shelved products when I heard someone loudly banging on the locked front doors. I could hear it all the way from the back of the store where I was wrapping a security tag onto an Xbox One X (important for later). While carrying the Xbox, I walk into view of the doors and see a 30-something year old woman banging her fist on the glass. I saw that she was wearing a jacket with the company color on it so I assumed she was a co-worker. She stopped banging when she saw me and waved hello. REMEMBER, I only work the before opening shifts so I never interact with customers BUT I also don't know all of my other co-workers who *do* work during store hours. I thought to myself ""oh! she must be one of the sales-reps."" because they often come in 30 minutes early if they have an opening shift and it was around 40 minutes until opening so it didn't raise any alarm with me.

I walk up to the front doors. There are two sets of them with a vestibule in between them. The first set opens to the outside and lets you into the vestibule, the second set opens to the vestibule and lets you into the store. The lady is standing outside. I take the Xbox I was holding and place it on a register counter nearest the doors. I unlock the second set of doors and step up to the first set and begin pushing it open when the lady shoves her body through the opening of the doors. I guess waiting 2 whole seconds for me to finish opening the door was too much for her. She is already passed the second set doors and walking into the store when I finish closing and locking both sets. She wasn't walking to a register to clock-in, she wasn't directly walking to any department, all she did was quickly look around the store before turning back to me and says ""Where is your game section? I'm looking for a Switch.""

My. Heart. Dropped. SHE WAS A CUSTOMER THAT I LET INTO THE STORE BEFORE OPENING! BIG NO-NO!

I start to internally panic a little but think to myself that all I need to do is get her out of the store. 

Me - ""I'm sorry ma'am but we don't open for another 40 minutes. I thought you were one of my co-workers when I let you in."" 

The crazy lady rolls her eyes and says ""the website says that you open at 8 am, it is 8:20."" 

Me - ""*Our* website says 9 am. I'm telling you 9 am, you need to leave.""

Crazy Lady - ""I only need to buy a Switch, I will be 10 minutes.""

She begins to walk further into the story when I stand in her path.

Me- ""You can buy whatever you want at 9 am but right now, you need to leave.""

This lady is getting pissed and says ""I want to speak to your manager right now!""

Now, I was the only one working in the warehouse that morning (we are really understaffed) but there was a supervisor in the back office doing paperwork. The supervisor is a really understanding dude so I knew he wouldn't get mad at me for letting this crazy lady in by mistake but I made the idiot decision to deal with this myself.

Me - I am the only one here, now leave!

This is a good time to tell you all that I am a 5' 3"" 110lbs female who looks like a 15 year old when I'm really in my 20's. I do not look intimidating in any way.

The crazy lady got this smirk on her face and said ""fine, I'll go."" and when she started to walk to the doors I think that's the end of it UNTIL SHE GRABS THE XBOX OFF OF THE COUNTER AND TRIES TO UNLOCK THE DOORS! I rushed up to her and begin to tug at the Xbox while yelling at her to ""let go!"" and ""I will call the police!"" The Xbox was wrapped in a security tag so the whole time this tug-of-war was happening the door alarms are blaring because of the tag. My supervisor hears the alarm and comes out of the back office to find me wrestling with this fucking crazy Karen. He comes over to help but not before the crazy lady punched me hard in the stomach. I let go of the Xbox to hold my stomach but she still doesn't have the door unlocked. I ended up puking on her and the Xbox because she punched me so hard. She drops the Xbox and goes to hit me again but I saw this one coming and mustered up all my strength and rage to kick her square in the chest.

I might not look strong but I can damn well be when needed...but I only had the strength for that one kick, I rolled into a ball and agonized over the pain afterwards.

My supervisor called the police while the woman whined in pain and was STILL trying to unlock the door... I guess she didn't realize that keys are used to open doors.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dga993/well_thats_one_way_to_make_guacamole/,"Well That's One Way to Make Guacamole This story happened back during the very first weeks my family bought our supermarket. Please keep in mind we were still very new to the business world and had not yet been able to maintain professional appearances at all times.

I was about 10 years old at the time hanging out by the registers when Crazy woman came wanting to return an avocado. Issue was she had a large green avocado whereas we only sold the small black ones therefore we could not do a return. Upon being told this she became belligerent and screaming at the top of her lungs about poor customer service.

My mom (owner) hearing the commotion came down from the store office and tried to reason with her and calm down the situation to no avail. Crazy Lady became so enraged she decides to throw the avocado onto the counter causing the avocado pit (which was quite large and could've been pretty painful) to almost hit me and also splatter some green goo on me.

This caused my mom to go full Mama Bear on her and proceeded to grab the avocado mush and fling it straight back at Crazy Lady. This led to 30 glorious seconds of pure green chaos as they flung it back and forth towards each other until the lady finally exited the store (covered in green). Definitely not the most professional moment of our career but certainly very entertaining.

Tragically through we did suffer a great loss because of this. During the avocado battle a green blob fatally struck a passing fly causing it to drown  in a pile of unseasoned guac. I hope he knew that his death was not in vain and he was able have a taste of that glorious guac before he passed from our world."

I asked her what day it was and she proceeds to tell me it was on a Wednesday. Saying ""this isn't how we should run our businesses."" Like ma'am, I don't answer to you so I don't know who this ""we"" is but okay...

Immediately I rebuke that statement, only mentally, because I closed on Wednesday and have never locked those doors even a second before they were supposed to be.

Rather than call her out for it though, as she does spend fairly decent sums of money with us, I turned the situation around and informed her I'd have a talk with my staff about ensuring that the doors do stay open until 6pm so that it doesn't happen again (even though it didn't happen to begin with.)

TL;DR: Customer told me the store closed prematurely on a day I worked when I know for fact it didn't and I'm just not sure how she could possibly be daft enough to not figure out how to read a clock."

I work at an international super market chain that allows staff to sit at tills.

I was having a pretty swell day, nearly every customer had been a friendly regular so all is cruisy. Untill I spot an older woman, whos trying reallllllly hard to look younger, unloadinger her trolly onto my tread.

She brings the trolly up but leaves some produce in it, I ask her if they were from our store, she doesnt answer. Instead she pushes back past some customers in line to grab more bags. I just start pulling out the prod and scanning it in, I could tell it was ours but wanted to give her a chance to get it out herself.

I scan in all her groccerries quietly, things are chill and it come to $149.07.

I read the total and ask her 'cash or card?'. She doesnt answer again and just contiues to slowly put the items in one at a time.

I assume she didnt hear and wait untill she finishes, i read the total again and finally get an answer of card.

I enable the eftpos and she sticks her card in, she then asks what the total is, keep in mind it's displayed on the eftpos machine. I repeat the total a third time for her, still cheery and smiling.

Her card declines, cool no issue, she asks if she can pay some with cash and then the rest on card.

'oh of course, no worries' I say as I accept the cash off her. She says it's $50 just as I'm putting it in but I still half of it in hand and I remembered exactly what she gave. One $20, one $10 and two $5.

A little dread knot forms as I knew she wouldnt take the facts of basic math well.

i start to explain what she's actually given me but she cuts me off and instantly gets aggresive while repeating 'It's $50! I gave you $50, that's $50'. I learnt from this sub about quick change artists and I also didnt want my till to be out, least of all for someone like this. 

I start to get the adrenline shakes, i hate this as it makes my voice quiver even though I'm not scared of this woman in the slightest. I don't want her to hear my voice shake and think its an opening to attack so I quickly but politely tell her.

'I'll have to quickly go and count my till, that way I know exactly what it is. I'll call a manager up so we can suspend this in the mean time'

While waiting for a manager, she doesnt take long to go from frustrated to full blown bitch.

'Go ahead! I can wait, I've got All day!' ... I know she's trying to use the waiting que to preasure me, I just smile and say no worries, she gets madder.

'Yeah! I can stand here all day, rather than just sitting around, i can pull up a chair too! How about you offer me a seat too huh?!' 

I'm dumb founded but keepy face neutral. The line is long and full of regulars who LOVE me, none of the other tills have chairs so I smile, stand and say. 'Not a problem Ma'am, please, feel free to have My chair'

I awkwardly push my office chair out of the register cube and directly to her, she sits down without a thank you while everyone in line judges her harshly.

I know they're all on my side if I need a witness to vouch.

A manager finally arrives, suspends the customer's sale and jumps in for me while I go to count. I'm not even to the office door 10 meters away when I hear her screaming at him for moving her trolly aside so he can serve others.

She starts yelling.

'Don't you touch my Trolly! I JUST WANT TO BUY MY GROCCERIES! (she points over at me) I ALREADY GAVE THAT GIRL $50 AND SHE ACCUSED ME OF SHORT CHANGING HER! THE LIAR I WOULD NEVER!'

I & the manager make eye contact and I try to give a look that says 'no i definitly fucking didnt' and left to count up.

While counting, I could hear her SCREAMING through the thick brick walls, i couldnt make out words but she was consistently going for it. With our money weighing machine, it only took me a few minutes to count and it turned out I was right, she only gave me $40.

I head back out and she's practically out the doors, attempting to leave with her FULL trolly. The manager who jumped in for me has left the till and is refusing to let go of her trolly and she's screaming right in his face.

'I ALREADY GAVE THE GIRL $50, GIVE ME MY FUCKING SHOPPING!'

Then suddenly, like an angel, our head manager arrives out of No where, just in time. He mellowed her out by telling her she had two choices.

Either come back in and pay or he'll call the cops and file a report.

She gapes and says 'Of Course I want to PAY!'

sure you did

I gave the head manager the details and quickly went back to work, not wanting to be dragged into her maw of spite.

The manager ended up just giving her the $10 to get rid of her but also got her to pay for her grocceries. He basically said to us later that if she shows up again to buzz him immediately so he can boot her out.

PS. The customers who had all been waiting and dealing with her tantrum overheard that she did only give me $40. So they all laughed even harder at her when she left."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dg029v/some_customers_are_so_stupid/,"Some customers are so stupid I worked in a retail chain in the middle of a busy city in England about 10 years ago. The long tedious days of tidying up after arsehole customers made me leave in the end but that's not what this story is about. 

The company was a big nation wide one and even had some international shops and they ran promotions in different forms from one time to another. This one time I remember we had a ridiculous way of marketing a promotion, usually it would just be a blanket 20% off women's wear, or formal wear etc or £10 discount if you spend £40 etc. 

This particular time our manager explained that we had to give the customer a scratch card with (15% discount on every single one) but that we had to explain the card to customers even though it was printed on the scratch card, but just to speed things up a bit and give the customer the gist of the competition, but mosty importantly not to let anyone fail to get the discount. The question on the card was ""what is an anagram of disconut?"" I remember panicking because I couldn't remember what an anagram was and not wanting to look stupid in front of my manager quickly read the two options ""discount"" or ""sausage"". After realising it couldn't be sausage and it had to be discount as there were no s's in disconut. I remember thinking ""oh god were gona have so many people struggle with this question""

I kind of felt bad for the customers the first few days and if the struggled to remember what an anagram was,  I would explain it was like countdown and its just the letters in a different order. This got boring really quickly so I just decided that as the tickets were identical I'd just tell the customers it was answer A and they would get there discount. After about a month of this I got so bored of it I just let customers deal with it themselves and if they got it wrong just give them a new one and say ""try again, the tickets are identical"". 

After about 5 weeks of the 6 week promotion even the world stupidest customer comes to my till, I give her her scratch card, I scan her stuff, remove the security tags, bag it up and before i hit total i have to scan the scratch card to apply the discount so I ask the lady for the scratch card, she has scratched answer B, it says sorry you weren't correct or something to that effect. Not wanting her to lose the discount. I gave her a new one and she scratched off B again. I explained that the tickets were identical and she should have another go. She scratched off B again. At this point I wondering if she is taking the piss but I'm a bit bored so whatever. I give her a 4th scratchcard, B again. The que is starting to grow a bit now and even though there are 7 or 8 tills, its a busy shop so I say this will have to be your last go I'm afraid and give her a scratch card. I have no words as I saw her scratch off B again. At this point i had to tell her that I'm sorry but she does not qualify for the 15% discount and she quite merrily paid full price then said ""I can't believe how unlucky I am 5 wrong in a row"" I said yes you must be very unlucky that's a record in this store"" and she went on her way. 

I told my boss and the girls that worked there about it and we all had a good laugh and that year at the Christmas party ever person got a joke award prize and I got mine for the only person in the store to refuse a customer free discount."

I had this one family just after 9:00 who had been at my till for quite some time now, it normally takes 2-3 minutes to serve one person with that amount of shopping but the family I served spent ages and were collectively arguing over silly little things and asking me which products were better value for money (I'd understand with a large piece of furniture but arguing with each other between £3 or £4 fairy lights is ridiculous). I told the mother who looked as though she was buying all the products before me, that I wouldn't scan anything until she had decided (this affects my performance ratings) and stressed how the shop was already closed. She sarcastically sympathised with me before blatantly talking to her family about my ""awful"" customer service. Eventually we came to scan some rugs she picked up which showed up as £85 on the till, the mother then *exploded* and *demanded* I reduce the price to £35 as she allegedly saw a label for it. I didn't believe this and called someone from the rugs department to check the label and all the while she was right next to me shouting how she would take the phone from my hand and explain how ""*I am offering a very poor service and should be sacked*"". I had to cover my ear to hear the man from rugs and apparently the £35 rug the family supposedly thought they picked up was a smaller size than the £85 rug. These two rugs were the exact same design however the £35 being a smaller size. I explained this to the family and they then accused me of selling them a rug they had never seen before and how I was basically robbing them \*sigh\* . My manager heard the commotion and offered to walk the mother over to see the rug in question which slowly defused the whole situation and eventually left rug-less.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dfznqv/its_too_early_for_this/,"It’s too early for this This is my first time posting any kind of text story to Reddit, so please be gentle with my formatting mistakes. 

Background- 
I’m the manager of a store in the “rent to own” industry. I fell into it like 8 years ago and well... bills kept me working here. I have a lot of wonderful customers, and an equal number of infuriatingly stupid ones. That’s just the business.

A few months ago I had a long time customer want to swap out merchandise on an account she was halfway done paying on. There are two ways I can do this. One is to type up a brand new agreement and adjust the number of payments remaining. The other is to just do an inventory swap. This means that all of the terms (payment amount, number of payments remaining, etc) remain exactly the same. The only thing changed is the merchandise being paid on. That’s it. We did the swap. I knew it would screw me a little since the new system had a higher cost, but this was a good customer and I wanted to make them happy. 

Today-
So the store opens at 10A and it’s 9A when this customer pulls up outside. Since I knew she was just making a payment, I let her in an hour early. 
She immediately starts YELLING about not getting credit for her old merchandise. Now she wasn’t exactly articulate, so it took a minute to understand her complaint. Once I did, I repeatedly tried to show her that we did an inventory swap so she hasn’t lost a single penny of what she paid on the old inventory. 

She just keeps shouting that she doesn’t want to hear it, and a female district manager told her that she didn’t get credit. 
(We don’t have a female district manager. Every single manager above me is male. All the way up to the CEO. My staff is also entirely male aside from me.) Hearing this she starts saying that I must have told her this then. I try AGAIN to explain that I wouldn’t have told her that as it wasn’t true. She goes back to shouting that she doesn’t want to hear it. I offered to give her customer services number so they can explain it. She declines that too. She just wants to make her payment. As I’m scrambling to get change from the till which is still locked up in the back(remember, the store isn’t open yet), she’s shouting for us to just give her the change already. She’s done with us. Etc. Etc. 
She gets her change and stomps out still shouting about how this is bullshit and we are fucking her over. 

And that’s the shit I can’t stand. If she had just managed to conduct herself like an adult for 5 minutes, I could easily have explained to her exactly what we did, and how she’s exactly where she left off. I have literal mountains of paperwork proving what we did. But because she was so set on having her stupid tantrum, she has worked herself up over a fictitious issue. 

tl;dr-  Gave a customer nicer, more expensive merchandise for the same price/payoff as what they had. Customer throws a fit because she thinks she started over on it when she didn’t, won’t listen to proof otherwise. Treats the person who did her a favor like garbage. Is now banned from getting anything else."

I am working part time at an organic supermarket, so aside from the normal strange customers, we also have a whole lot of esoteric folks running around. But these people are mostly quite normal, if you forget about the pendulums and their obsession for homeopathy. But this man was just crazy. 

So, after about 2 months of working there, i was still quite nervous as a cashier, even if i was pretty used to the things you expierence in this position by now.  In the later hours of a day in mid-december a man was going to be checked out by me. He was pretty wealthy looking, which isn't unusual, because many of our customers are wealthy middleclass people. 

I can't really remember what he was buying, but it wasn't much, i think he only bought some apples and tofu. He wanted to pay with his bank card. Because the confirmation process ist mostly done by siganture, so whe have the device for the cards next to us and not in front of the customer. He gives me his card and i realise there is something on the card, it felt and smelled like glue, so i thought to myself, that i would give the customer a heads up, so he does not smear this goo on himself and his groceries. (The conversation was originally in german and 3 years ago, so i some things might not translate, or be remembered very well) 

Me: ""Excuse me, but could it be possible that you have glue on your hands, there is something on your card."" 

C: (going immediatley into full on rage mode) ""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU CAN'T JUST ACCUSE CUSTOMERS TO HAVING GLUE ON THEIR HANDS!"" 

Me: (extremely confused at this point, because he seemed totally normal before) ""Sorry, i just wanted...""

C:""WHY DO YOU EVEN ASSUME I HAVE GLUE ON MY HANDS? I WAS IN THE LABORATORY THE ENTIRE DAY, HOW SHOULD I HAVE GOTTEN GLUE ON MY HANDS? THIS IS EXTREMELY UNPOLITE OF YOU!"" 

By this point i was totally quiet and just let it go over me, because i was feared to saying anything. He would rage the entire payment process and left VERY angry looking. The customers that stood after him in line looked as confused as me. 

To this day, i still don't know what made him this angry and i don't know why he felt the need to state the lab. Maybe he was hiding something, or maybe (and more likely) he just had a bad day. But still, this was just strange as hell."

Me: Service desk, this is (name). How can I help you?  
Guy: I got a letter in the mail telling me the item I got a raincheck on is in.   
Me: Well, that means you need to come pick it up. 

The guy doesn’t say anything and I’m confused because we don’t send out letters for rainchecks. I stand there for a while waiting for him to respond but he doesn’t so I assume he tried to hang up and it didn’t work or something. So, after a minute or so, I just hang up. 

A few minutes later the phone rings and I see it’s the same guy. 


Me: Service desk, this is (name). How can I help you?  
Guy: We were talking a few minutes ago, something must have gone wrong when you tried to transfer me. 

I’m thinking: I never said anything about transferring you, where did that idea come from?

Me: Okay, what did you need?

He tells the same thing and says what the item is and I tell him what I told him the first time. 

Guy: But I already picked it up! It’s sitting right here next to me on the couch.  

That just made things seem more weird, because it is a 8 ft tall blow up Halloween skeleton. Like, why is that chilling with you on your couch. But, it’s whatever. 

Me: Well, if you already have it, then you can just disregard the letter.    
Guy: But the letter came to my house today!! I don’t want my reputation ruined because I didn’t come pick up the item! 

Dude. The item isn’t here. Even if it was, no ones going to care if you don’t pick it up. It’ll just go back out on the sales floor after your ten days to get it are up. And there’s no “reputation” that’ll be ruined. I don’t know what made him think that it’s a thing. 

Me: What’s the date on the letter?   
Guy: September 21st.   
Me: And what day did you get your item?
Guy: Last Wednesday. (October 2nd)   
Me: That means the letter was sent out before you got the item.   
Guy: But the letter just came today!

At this point I’m just frustrated. It’s a Sunday, so it’s obviously from a previous day, when mail is actually delivered. I spend another 5 minutes explaining this over and over to the guy until he gets it. After he finally understands, he says this. 

Guy: Well, okay then. I’ll let you get back to watching the football game.  
Me, very confused: I... I’m at work?

The guy then proceeds to tell me about the game from another 3 minutes. I had customers waiting, I don’t even like football, and it took him that long to tell me that the score was 0-0. Overall, it sucked."

A little background: My family owns a small supermarket in an area that is predominantly Hispanic so the main language of most customers and our employees is Spanish. Since I'm the owner's daughter/ store manager and am bilingual the task of dealing with English speaking customers usually falls on to me or my brother if he's also working. The issue with this is while I'm a 23 Female College Student I look very young for my age therefore people mistake me as an lowly 15 year old and rarely given me any respect as a manager so it can be hard to control some customers. This story is such a case

A cashier calls me over because a customer would like to make a return but he does not have a receipt. Now our policy is that no cashier can make any returns without the receipt but since I'm the manager I have the power to override this if I feel there's a real issue with the product or if I recognize the customer and believe that they really did buy it from us.

The man in question was one I did not recognize as a regular in our store and the product in question for a return was a bottle of vegetable oil that had expired 2 YEARS AGO. Now I'm not going to pretend that my store is perfect and we never have any damaged or expired items on shelves that we missed but something that expired 2 years ago? Very unlikely that we would've missed that. 

Either way I asked the man if he had his receipt. He proceeds to tell me that he does not because another man had came into the store and bought it for him. I tell him that I can not do the return without the receipt and if he can ask to see if his friend still had it. He tells me that he can not because he does not know the man. Ummmmmm

He continues saying that a stranger came with his wife and kids and bought the groceries and he cannot ask for the receipt because he does not know him. I then ask him if he could ask his wife if she could get the receipt from this ""stranger"" and he starts to scream about he can't contact the other man because he is a stranger and he does not know him........but he came to the store with his wife and kids. I tell him there is nothing I can do for him and he starts screaming and insulting every part of my being (my appearance, personality and even spirituality) because I'm such a cruel person for not letting him return the 2 year old vegetable oil that a stranger bought for him."

I took the item and did what I have to do with them. She was so appreciative. Genuinely happy. It honestly made my day to see how happy taking 15 minutes and helping her figure out technology made her."

I had just started my evening shift, and I was filling the potatoes at the front of the store. 

OL: ""Who's in charge around here?!"" 

A lady, probably late 60's if I was to guess, was standing beside the oranges half way down the isle looking straight at me. I briefly looked around to see if C or S were around but they were out back. 

Me: ""How can I help you?""

OL: ""Now I got these oranges earlier in the week and they are just AWFUL! They are disgusting! They shouldn't even be on the shelf they are so sour!""

Now, the bag she got was prepackaged, and labelled reduced to clear at a cheaper price as they were the last of our NZ Oranges at that point. However, we hadn't had oranges at all for at least 2 weeks. Meaning that she had these oranges from probably 3 weeks ago, that she is bringing back now, without a receipt.

Cue C coming into the store, looking at me as I look at him pleadingly to save me, smiling, suppressing laughter, before walking to fill a shelf. 

OL is still going on about how bad the oranges were and how she should get them replaced (it was a bag of 3) AND she should get the ones she was planning to purchase anyway free too! Also asking if the Australian Oranges were any better.

Thankfully, S came out, saw her beside me, and rescued me. I think she ended up getting 3 free. We were talking out back after it happened, turned out she's been coming in weekly for the past couple months doing the same thing. 


Skip forward a couple months (this happened probably 3 months ago?), S comes in on another shift to tell us that OL called earlier that day and that we should expect a visit from her that evening after she complained about the oranges again because ""they are too sour!"" and apparently, ""my husband likes them sweet!"""
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/df311t/free_trials/,"Free Trials **Background:**

I work at the customer service desk at a warehouse store where a membership is required to shop. Everyone who opens a membership has to come to the desk, if only to pick up their store cards when they open the account online. If not, we process the new account in store.

Every so often, corporate sends out offers for a ""free 3 - month trial membership."" These are part of a mass mailing list (I've worked there for two years and I get them occasionally), and the main goal is to get new customers in the door. Printed on every one of these mailers is ""NEW MEMBERS ONLY."" Existing customers cannot open a trial, but the flyer also includes a promo code for a discounted renewal for existing members (Over half off).

**Cast:**

>Me: Me

>AG: Angry Guy

>MOD: Manager on Duty, not in my department

**The Story:**

Last Saturday, I was working at the desk when an older gentleman came in. He threw the flyer down and asked me to open a trial.

>AG: Hi, I'd like to use this free 3-month offer.

>Me: Sure, have you ever been a member with us before?

>AG: No.

>Me: Okay, I just need an ID and I can start processing the account right away.

When people open memberships, their driver's license number is entered along with name, address, etc. Because of this, corporate asks that we check new members against the database to make sure they are not taking advantage of promotional offers like this. I enter his license number, and an account shows up. No surprise there, people try to pull this all the time.

>Me: Unfortunately, there's already an account in your name. I won't be able to process the trial because that offer is only good for new customers.

Most people realize they've been caught in a lie, and I'll then offer to renew the old account for a discount. It's about half and half whether people do that or say ""never mind."" AG was neither.

>AG: WELL THEN WHY DID I GET THIS FLYER? IF I GET THIS IN THE MAIL, I *EXPECT* IT TO BE HONORED.

>Me: I do apologize, but I don't have a way to put this through without my computer blocking it (not technically true, but I can get in trouble for overriding it. Also, when corporate secret shops the store, they check to make sure we aren't opening new accounts for existing customers).

>AG: WELL THEN I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE STORE MANAGER BECAUSE UNTIL YOU GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER AND TAKE ME OFF THE MAILING LIST I EXPECT THIS TO BE HONORED.

>Me: Sure, just a moment.

I get on the radio and page the manager on duty to the front desk. Meanwhile, my coworker, who is with her own customer, looks over at me and (out of view of the customer) mouths ""what the f***???""

While we wait for the manager, AG starts ranting to me about how he's never been a PAID member and will never become one, which suggests he will continue to scream at employees until he gets his way.

The MOD arrives about a minute later; he was on the opposite end of the store. Unfortunately for me, he's brand new to the store and isn't in my department (He's head of merchandising). My direct manager, who wouldn't have taken any of this, had left sick for the day.

>MOD: What did you need?

AG goes on a rant, pretty much repeating everything he just said to me but emphasizing that *I* won't allow him to open another trial. MOD, not being familiar with our policies, tells me that it's fine to bypass it for the day, and AG's attitude changes like a light switch. He was so nice to me for the rest of the transaction that it was almost disturbing. For what it's worth, MOD did come back about 10 minutes later and apologize for making me put it through. I guess he realized how it made me look and it hopefully won't happen again.

AG had left with his new card, but I wasn't done investigating. Searching by driver's license only turned up one account, but looking up his name revealed that he had opened 5 free trials over the last 3 years and at multiple locations. My guess is he screams enough until someone snaps and just does it for him, but thankfully, I left a VERY long note for the customer service manager along with a screenshot of every membership number he's ever had. His driver's license and name have been flagged in our database for trial abuse. Hopefully, the poor employee he screams at next time will see that and refuse the sale."

Later on, I had a gentleman pay another, older customer's purchase and thank him for his (military) service.

Then, I got called over to help a woman check if a rocking chair she was eager to buy could fit into her car. First two ladies came over and suggested another way of putting it in the trunk. It would have worked if the car's trunk lid would have had somewhere to attach a bungee cord. So she was thinking of trying to contact her daughter to borrow her car when two other women heard the conversation, and said they had a truck, and would drive the rocking chairs (turned out she wanted two of them) to her home! A great gesture, completely out of the blue!

It may not be a great deal, but I just had to share.

Oh, yeah, I had forgotten the other happening. 

Earlier in the day, one of my co-workers, call her M, was accused of not giving back a lady's change ( a $20 bill). No screaming, no cussing but she still was a little upset by it. M knew she had given back the change.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/deu2fj/escaped_convicts_in_the_mall/,"Escaped convicts in the mall! Last week was the most interesting day of work I’ve ever had. It started out like a typical Sunday. Slow traffic but there was 5 of us working so we were just trying to keep busy and helping out what customers we had. We get a phone call and one of my coworkers answers it and then says the call is for our store manager. So she goes up to answer it. I go over to help some customers out when over my radio I hear my store manager say “there’s a situation in the mall, get the customers out we need to evacuate” I didn’t know what the situation was but we usually only talk about what to do in the event of a mall shooting so I automatically assume that is what was about to go down. So I listen to the store manager and tell the two customers we had “hey there’s a situation in the mall, I don’t know what it is but we need to close the store and evacuate.” Luckily these two customers were good about it and dropped what they were carrying and left. I then ran up and shut the gate while my co workers ran in the back and grabbed our stuff to leave. I’m still freaking out trying to listen for gun shots (which thankfully never happened). Once my coworkers got back out from the back room we started to head out of the mall. My friend told me we were all going to my car since my trusty Mom van could fit all 5 of us in it. My store manager goes to run into other stores to tell them and their customers to get out and start evacuating as the fire alarm goes off. (Normally the whole mall ignores the fire alarm because it frequently goes off at random times for no reason at all) I get everyone out to my car, and once my store manager comes out and gets in the car too we drive off. We still weren’t entirely sure what was going on but we just knew we couldn’t be anywhere near the mall. So I took all my co workers in my falling apart Mom van and get us out. We were all panicked so I just drove us around the city and showed them all different places I knew about just to make the situation better. We started to get info that the reason we had to evacuate is that 4 escaped convicts from the next state over were sighted at our mall and were possibly dangerous. We drove around for two hours before we were able to drive back to the mall. During that time I took them to my college campus, and then to my house to pet dogs (which we all got paid to do btw) It got to the point where two of my coworkers would have finished their shift so we all just drove them home. On the way there we found out that the mall was safe and reopening. (We still don’t know why they thought it was a good idea to open since by that point it was almost time for the mall to close. On Sundays we aren’t open for long to begin with) But the 3 of us head back to the store to just finish the day thinking we wouldn’t be busy so we could just clean things for the last hour we were open. We were wrong. We were busier after the fact than we were before the convicts were sighted. So while I was getting alerts on my phone to stay inside and lock my doors because they were never actually caught, their were people taking their young children to the mall! The last place these people were seen! And at this point everyone knew why the mall was closed! But there were still people there! We weren’t super friendly with the customers that came in because by that point we were over it and just wanted to be home after the whole scare. We didn’t go out of our way to help them like we are normally supposed to do. Then I got a phone call from someone asking if I could do a price adjustment over the phone for them since the mall was closed earlier and no one would let her in. I told her I can’t do any kind of transaction over the phone and she was mad about that and I just apologized until she hung up. My store manager told me that I should have told her “yeah sorry that we were closed we had escaped convicts hiding in the mall.” It still baffles me that people tried to walk into the mall while it was surrounded by police, helicopters circling it, and employees from other stores that didn’t leave all standing on the hill and in the parking lot outside the mall. 


I did hear later about how they found out that the convicts were at the mall. Apparently after escaping, someone from the outside got them a car and they drove and ended up in our quiet area. A mall employee was outside smoking and they asked her to borrow her phone. She let them and then after they left she got a call from an unknown number saying that “hey the person who just let you borrow your phone is an escaped convict” so she then called the police. Apparently another one of the guys asked another mall employee for gas money and got denied. They later found clothing tags in a bathroom along with some of the clothing the guys had been previously wearing. And they were later captured another state over. Apparently this is the second time one of them escaped this month and one of the guys was driving his own car. 

TL;DR: my coworkers and I got paid to pet my dogs while police looked for 4 escaped convicts in my mall!"

Older gentleman, let's call him Bob, came into the store with a broken hurricane lamp. I work at a family owned lighting store that has been here for 75ish years so this is common. We have spare glass in the back for most fixtures. 

The glass had broken and there were several sharp edges. He asked if I could repair it so I went over to look at it, I notice he's holding his left hand. Then I notice the lamp is covered in blood, to the point it's dripping. I cannot stress this enough, I ***DO NOT*** like blood, but I can deal with it if someone's in danger. Plus, I know a few medical things thanks to my training in the Army. 

Bob proceeds to ask if we have a bandaid. I ask him to look at the cut (to gauge what size bandage he needs) and this thing is pouring blood. He lacerated a vein on the top of his hand. Bob proceeds to shake his hand spraying blood in various directions. 

After getting pressure reapplied to his wound, which he didn't want to do, he asked me to remove the blood covered, broken glass from this lamp. I walked into the back room, took a hammer, and smashed it getting the glass (and blood) into the trash can with his permission. Took what was left and dropped it off in his truck. Offered to drive him to the hospital but he declined. 

Now I'm cleaning the showroom to get rid of his blood, which also got on my forearms, hands, and face. I am viscerally disgusted."

Background: I work in the eCommerce department of a well known retail store. Basically, when people order their groceries off our website, we grab things off the shelf, organize their order, and load it into their car at our designated parking spots. Customers check in through an app or call to let us know they are here. We have a department cellphone that one person dispensing orders keeps on them. I had it at this time.

I was outside finishing up another customer's order when a second car pulls up. I walk over to make sure he's checked in so I can find his order and get it to him. As soon as I walk up to him he raises a finger and hushes me before I can speak. He has out his cellphone and I can already see where this is going.

Me: Sir, I can check you in, theres no need to call since I have the phone anyways.

Customer: Just let me call the number so I can get my groceries!

At this point the phone begins ringing in my pocket and he still has his finger up hushing me. 

Me: Umm, I have the phone so you'd just be talking to me anyways. I just need your name so I can check you in?

I grab the phone and show him his number coming through. I'd also like to mention he's smoking a pipe and just casually blows the smoke in my direction (this is actually infuriatingly common). At this point he's also looking visibly frustrated that no one is answering the phone.

Customer: I just wanted to call! I thought calling was anonymous! (what?) \*more incomprehensible muttering and anger\*. 

At this point I'm just silent waiting for him to hang up so that we could move on from this. He doesn't. He lets it go to voicemail. Looking back, I had the perfect opportunity to just answer and be a smart ass, but, I was too stunned in the moment to really do anything. I wish I could say anything else interesting happened after this but it didn't, a coworker came out with his order after I got his name and I went back inside."

I go through my usual ""How are you today,"" and scan and bag everything. When it comes time to pay for the order, only one of the two guys is paying (PG, short for paying guy) and he wants it split between two separate cards. Okay, still no problems so far. Then PG gets a phone call before he can tell me how to split it. I don't hear the other end of the call, but the PG says ""I'm at the counter, about to pay as we speak."" I do hear a faint bit of yelling on the other end before PG asks ""Here, you want to talk to the guy at the counter?"" He then puts the phone up to me...

I hear a loud, raspy female voice on the other end. I mean, she's just straight up YELLING. I couldn't make out anything she was saying for the life of me.

The customer I was helping was being a bit difficult and refused to answer my questions about his t-shirt order and decided to go over my head to the owner of the business as, I quote, ""I got tha head owner's number right here, his personal cell phone I'll have you know. I'll just give him a ring and we'll see what he says about you being stupid.""

He called my brother, who was in the other room wearing sterile gloves, and followed the sound of the ringing to the Bluetooth speaker sitting on our T-shirt stand my brother has connected to his personal cell phone, which is also the shop phone and plays music through.

He was completely baffled while I popped over to where my brother was and explained.

Agitated my brother removed his gloves, desanitized and walked over to the guy to see what his deal was.

He wound up telling my brother he wanted my brother to put a picture on a shirt that was an original character of a local artist's comic book but didn't want to buy the actual merch from the original artist who was struggling to get his name out there.

My brother kicked him out, told him if he wanted something else he would have to schedule an appointment, not to come back until his appointment, then sterilized again and got back to work while I reorganized the t-shirts display the guy had trashed looking for the phone that was ringing."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/degwb1/the_line_forms_here/,"“The line forms here!” Hey all I’m back with another tale! This one is about when customers can’t read the big sign saying “line forms here!”...Wellup here we go! 

So at my store, each register location is different...at mine register location, we have four registers with one “line forms here” sign and the typical black divider thing, it’s pretty simple and easy to see but people still get it wrong. 

We can only two registers because the other two are on the other side and people tend to line up behind the person, when there is a line with other people waiting. One day I was ringing this lady up at the register next to where the “line forms here” sign was, it’s going fine when these two ladies come up and stand on the side of the register. 

I ask them if they need help because that’s what some people do sometimes, they say that they are waiting to be checked out and I direct to where the line was...they say that no one is there so they continue to stand there and talk loudly while I’m ringing up my customer. I’m getting annoyed while trying to have this interaction with my customer. 

After I’m done ringing up my customer, I see there is another lady who goes where the sign was and asks us for help with something. She was in the store earlier for a payment so we had to clear up some confusion. As I’m doing that, the two ladies put their things on the previous register counter and wait.

After I’m done clearing up the confusion, I call them over...one of them says something under their breath about why they need to go over there, I smile and give my best retail voice and personality as I’m ringing them up just to annoy them."

I was helping out a different customer, and I was faced away from the impulse buys. We had a whole box of those popular stress balls shaped like food. So I'm completing this transaction, all is going well and I was soon to go home, so pretty hyped. 

All of a sudden, I feel pain on the side of my face. My first instinct: ""I'm getting robbed"". Also side note, I had just gotten an ear piercing as well on that side, so it really felt great. I turned my head towards the source, and there is a man, who looks to be around mid 30's, laughing his ass off. I looked on the ground next to me and there was the source, a little chocolate cupcake stress toy, meant to relieve stress, and just ended up causing so much more.

The man comes up and says, ""Hey, I'm sorry about that, you just looked so bored up there and I wanted to add some excitement to your day"". 

Guys. This man thought that by chucking a toy at the high school cashiers face, that her day would be brightened and she would have a laugh along with him

I wish this was the part of the story where I say that I told him off, kicked him out of the store, and everybody clapped.

That did not happen. See, I was a very timid 17 year old who just wanted him to leave, so I quickly finished the transaction and he left. 

I need a stress toy."

Before this staff member even makes it in the door I can hear a someone harassing her. I got out to see what’s going on, and essentially a customer is wanting to exchange a faulty item. I go out and this customer is yelling at me already. 

C: These are broken, I have the receipt, I want to swap it for a new pair
Me: I can do that, however it can only be at 10 when we are open
C: it’s just a swap you can do it now
Me: I can’t, the registers aren’t open. We aren’t open 
C: I’m in management, other stores swap before trade
Me: that’s fine, but I can’t do it
C: fine I’m calling management

Well during his hospital stay with his gf while she had her baby and such his phone never stopped ringing and he usually will answer it with a phrase of (shop name) how can I help you?

While I was visiting on their last day in the hospital the in room phone rings and he makes to pick it up, stops and sighed, then answered it like a normal person.

He answered the question the staff had and when he hung up he sort of grinned sheepishly and said ""I had to stop and breathe a second, I almost answered it with (shop name) how can I help you? And I didn't want anyone here to realize who I am while we're in here.""

Obligatory info. I work as a department lead in a retail store that sells everything from home goods to apparel to groceries.

We have a desk area on the sales floor that has a computer and a few other things there. The amount of people who think it's a register is kind of astounding, but that's not really the point of this story even though that's how it began. I was standing at this computer with my scanner looking up stuff in our system to update out of stocks in my department when a man came up.

Me - ""Hello, can I help you with anything today?""

Him - ""yes, I'd like to check out""

Me - ""oh, I'm sorry, this isn't a register but there's one just over this way."" I indicate the direction of the nearest register.

Him - ""oh, ok, you know, my kid works here.""

Me - ""That's nice, it's a good job, I've been here a while. Who is that? I might know them.""

Him - ""(name I don't know)""

Me - ""I don't know that person, but I'll keep an eye out for them and say hi if I see them.""

Him - ""you know, *kid* lives with me. I can't remember their phone number for their card, can you look it up?"" He indicates the computer I'm at.

Me - ""I'm sorry, I don't have access to other employees phone numbers and that isn't something we would be allowed to give to a customer even if I did.""

Him - ""why not? They are my kid.""

Me - ""I cannot confirm that in any way.""

Him - ""I have id"" he starts to pull out his wallet.

Me - ""I'm sorry, but I still wouldn't be able to confirm that *name* is your child. Are they working today? You could find them and...""

Him - (interrupting) ""no, don't you think I would have done that already?""

Me - ""I'm sorry.""

Him - ""I want to talk to a manager.""

Me - ""I am the acting manager on shift today.""

Him - ""I want a reeeaaaaallll manager"" (yes, he said it like that)

Me - ""The manager of my department is not in the store at the moment, I can call.....""

Him - (interrupting) ""you are not a manager"" (points at my name tag) ""your tag does not say manager. I want (kid)'s phone number NOW!""

Me - ""I'm sorry but I cannot do that, sir. It would be a breach of privacy. I can call...""

Him - (interrupting) ""I'm (kid)'s FAAAATTTTHHHHEEERRRRR!!! I WANT THE NUMBER!!!!""

I just pulled out my phone and called another department's manager over while he was yelling this at me.

Him - ""DON'T IGNORE ME! GET OFF THE PHONE!""

Me into phone - ""hi (name) it's queenfrankie420 in (department). I have a customer over here at (location) and he's asking to speak to a manager. (My manager) is on lunch and not in the store right now, could you possibly come over?""

He's screaming at me the entire time and the other person says ""what in the world? I can hear him over HERE without the phone.... I'll be right there.""

Me into phone - ""thanks"" to customer ""(name) is on their way over to talk to you.""

Him - ""WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO YOUR JOB AND GIVE ME THE GD PHONE NUMBER????""

I ignored the question - ""(name) will be here in a moment to address that issue.""

He kept yelling at me and I repeated that line twice before the manager finally got there.

I don't know exactly what happened after that because they walked away together and I stayed there to complete my job.

Update! I talked to the manager this morning. The kid does work here and the person was their father but the kid doesn't live with his father and his father is a mentally ill abusive delusional man who isn't allowed contact with said child (or any other children) so...... We were told if we see him again to call the MOD and the cops will be here."

I know this has happened 5 hours ago, but this still pisses me off to no end. Since I live in a college town where I work, football Saturday is *cuh-raaaaaazy*, not to mention a little headache-inducing. So, we had a woman who was in her early-to-mid-twenties (we'll call her Almighty Queen Bee...or AQB for short) come in to buy a few things, and I went to cash her out...when I forgot to ring up her drink. 

*Dammit.*

So, I asked her if the drink was hers as well.

> AQB: Uhh, YEAH? Why didn't you scan it the first time?

> Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, I just didn't see it. I thought it was the woman's right behind you.

> AQB: *(scoffs)* Whatever.

Everything was going okay for a minute until I went to give her the receipt the way that I give receipts to all people: in a gentle, yet firm way so nobody would forget it, she goes and says this:

> AQB: Okay...what was THAT?!

> Me: Um...what was what? 

> AQB: The way you gave me that receipt? You know, I was gonna bite my tongue about you, but this is fucking ridiculous. 

> Me: *(confused)* Anh? 

> AQB: *(absolutely fuming now)* YOU SHOVED THE RECEIPT INTO MY HANDS. WHAT AM I TO YOU, THE LOWEST SCUM OF THE EARTH OR SOMETHING??? 

And that's when the woman right behind her (we'll call her Awesomely Snarky Customer, or ASC for short) started murmuring under her breath.

> ASC: *(mumbles)* Well, if the shoe fits...

Ohhhh, I was half-wishing for her not to hear that. Fuuuu...too late. 

> AQB: What did you just say?

> ASC: *(completely stonefaced)* Nothing. 

And with that, she lost it and just before storming out, she left us with this beautiful sentiment...

> AQB: *(flipping the whole store off)* FUCK YOU! 

And to make matters worse, the way she swung the door open on her way out, you'd think the door would fall straight off the hinges. I, the woman behind her, and her friend just looked at each other like, ""What the ever loving fuck?"" and started laughing. 

> ASC: *(laughing)* I was gonna bite my tongue about *her*, but...*(imitating AQB)* that was fucking ridiculous!

Ohhhh, I almost felt terrible for bursting out laughing then, but that pepped me up to the point that I almost forgot about it. All this time I was scanning ASC's items, we talked for a little bit and she reassured me that what'd happened was nothing to worry about. She said, ""Girl, there are a bunch of people like her out there, so get ready."" 

Ohhhh, am I ever. *Am I ever.* /s"

So last year I was working in a video rental store (I know, yes they do still exist)  anyways, I was probably 7 months pregnant at the time and having a rought day. So lady comes up complaining about a late fee on her account. I go thru my normal rundown of what the fee is for, when it's from, etc. 

Lady: well I didnt rent it. 
Me: ok I understand but maybe someone else rented it under your name, like maybe a child
Lady: ok but I didnt rent it I didnt pay it.
I repeat myself again. This is going on 10 mins at this point and the line is building, hormones are raging but I keep my cool.
She then precedes to PULL OUT HER PHONE  and call her daughter.  Still holding up the line, that is still building. After another 15 mins of her on the phone and going back and forth with me, she finally storms off after receiving a printout of her fee. 
The couple behind her who have been waiting for now 25 mins come up to the counter amd I apologize for the wait. The wife looks at me amd says ""it's ok we work in retail too."" The husband however was my hero of the day when he retorted ""I guess a ghost came and rented on her account "" I almost peed myself."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/ddomxu/i_want_it_on_my_card_oh_wait/,"I WANT IT ON MY CARD— Oh wait. As a cashier I process several refunds a day. I’ll generally get some sketchy ones and some normal ones. There was one I processed fairly recently that was beyond sketchy. Let me explain something first though.

The company I work for processes returns by scanning a barcode that comes printed on the bottom of EVERY receipt. We scan the barcode, then the item (if it matches up with the receipt) and input the return price of said item. After the return is finished, you may purchase other items in exchange or get the negative amount back in whatever way you paid with (except checks— that’s another story). 

Now this is what’s REALLY confusing. If you return an item at a different store in exchange for another item at that same store but you go to an entirely different store to return that exchanged item, you’re stacking returns. The money coming back on that second return will go on a gift card instead of what you paid with in the first exchange. Why the registers do it this way, I’ll never know. If you know, please enlighten me. 

Anyway I had a guy give me a receipt from another store with a returned wheelchair on the top for $149.99. In exchange for this wheelchair, he bought a walker worth $129.99. Mind you this exchange took place at an entirely different store.

So he wanted to return the walker he just bought in an exchange. I said “okay” and processed it. As I mentioned earlier, whenever items are double stacked like this in a return, the difference will go back on a gift card. He went into a hissy fit saying:

 “Oh my wife will kill me if I bring back a gift card. Can’t you just give me cash or just put the difference back on my debit card?”

I sighed and told him: “No sir we can’t. The way these transactions are set up, whenever returns are double stacked like this, the register forces us to put the difference back on a gift card regardless of what you used to pay before.”

He pulled the classic line: “Let me speak to your manager!”

I called a manager over and they were dumbfounded. They’d never heard of “stacked returns” before and tried voiding the whole transaction. The manager processed the entire thing the same way I did and didn’t understand why the register did what it did. 

This guy kept insisting we just put the difference back on his card. We kept saying no and he was getting angrier and sweatier. As soon as the manager mentioned that he could use the gift card at any of our other branches, he went:

“Oh I can? Cool! That works out then!”

He then walks away with gift card in hand and acting satisfied.

I’m sorry WHAT? 

A manager mentions something that should probably be common knowledge based on how much he “shops here”. The only thing that can satisfy him is a managers decision?

I wanted to punch a wall after that encounter."

I was ringing up a man who then got distracted and went to do more shopping. An elderly couple comes to the counter and is ready to check out so I started helping them instead.

We make some chit-chat and I run her card. Then I realize that I charged her for about $40 worth of the first man's purchase. I never cleared it out!

No problem, I explained what happened, voided the transaction, and gave her the new receipt with the correct items. She and her husband are very pleasant, kind, and understanding. I apologize again, everyone is happy, and they leave.

Five minutes later I get a phone call. It's PL. Somehow I forgot to delete one of the man's items from her total: a $3.00 chocolate. So I fix it *again* for her while she is on hold. I apologize profusely, thank her for her patience, and then SHE thanks ME! This lady is so sweet that she thanks me for fixing my own mistake.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/ddwcu4/can_i_get_some_change/,"“Can I Get Some Change?” So something happened at the retail store I work at today that I want to share.

I was behind the cashier counter and a woman comes in, holding two $20 bills, and asked me if I was the manager as she needed change. I’m thinking that’s she’s a worker from another store in the mall I work in. I was not the manager so I called for our new sales lead that was on the floor, as our store manager and co-manager were in the back room, and sales leads are technically managers of the store when the co-manager or store manager aren’t around or there at the store. The sales leads at our store also have the ability to open the cash register when it’s not for a purchase, and I was thinking that she had already been trained to do so even though she was relatively new. The lady told her that she needed change and our new sales lead then went to the back to ask if we could even give her the change. Like I said before, the woman was holding two $20 bills asking for change. She was asking for either twenty $1 bills.......or twenty $5 bills as twenty $5 bills equal $20, or something along that line because in my head I though “twenty $5 bills does not equal $20, four does 🤔.” Heck it doesn’t even equal $40 since she had two $20 bills. But I didn’t say that out loud lol. Our new sales came back and told her that we wouldn’t be able to give her change and she just walks out the store without saying anything. How rude.

I asked our new sales lead what did they say when she asked if they could give the woman change and she said “We aren’t a bank”. I immediately knew that it was our co-manager that answered with that lol. And honestly she’s right because we need our money in order to give change to customers who are purchasing their items with cash or are doing cash returns. Plus it turns out that the woman wasn’t an employee from another store, just a regular person roaming the mall, so we definitely couldn’t give her change.

I was just stuck on the fact that she literally said that twenty $5 bills would be the change for $20. You know how sometimes a person says something that makes you go “what?” in your head? That was one of those situations lol. told my mom about it sometime after I got home and she told me that she was probably trying to get more money from us. Maybe she was right."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/ddko95/where_do_you_go_to_pick_up_online_orders/,"""Where do you go to pick up online orders?"" This is my first post but I felt this story was interesting enough to be shared. So I work at a grocery store, and I stand at the door all day which means I answer the questions of every customer coming in with one. This couple came in and asked me a very simple question, ""Where do you go to pick up online orders?""

Now, the self checkout is in front of my door but to the right a little; if you look straight ahead you'll see all the way to the other side of the store to a set of doors leading to the back. If you look straight ahead and to up a little, you'll see a sign saying ""Pickup ➡.""

So, naturally, I pointed to the sign. ""Pickup is that way.""

The customer looked ahead, but not up. ""So... We go to the back of the store?""

""No, see the sign? Right there?""

""Are you saying we go to the back to pick up online orders?""

""No, no,"" At this point I had realized they hadn't and were not going to see the sign, so I pointed in the same direction it was pointing. ""Pickup is over there.""

I have forgotten their exact words by now, this was a few months ago, but the couple kept on asking if it was in the back and not really listening to me, until they decided to go ask another employee by self checkout for clarification.
I could hear them say that I ""don't know where pickup is"" and ""as an employee she should know where it is.""

As soon as they were gone, my coworker came up to me and was like ""You know, pickup is--""

""I know where pickup is. I was pointing at the sign there,"" I pointed at the sign, ""and when they still didn't understand I pointed that way,"" I pointed to the right, ""but they would not listen to me.""

And that was that.

Except it wasn't.

So then I get another coworker a few minutes later trying to tell me where the pickup is, amd I have that exact conversation, again.

And again. Except when the third coworker came up to me, as I was explaining to her that the customers weren't listening to me, one of the customers came up and apologized to me because she ""wasn't aware it was my first day."" I'd been there for a week. Anyway, after that people stopped bothering me about pickup.

The worst part of it is that pickup is right along the wall. You walk in, turn right and there it is. You can't miss it.

Edit: I can't leave the door, I couldn't just lead them there."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dddmre/are_you_calling_my_son_a_liar/,"""Are you calling my son a liar?!"" Obligatory 'on mobile, first time posting', etc

So I work in a store that sells video games and accessories, and our returns policy is that if something is still sealed, we'll return it within thirty days. If it's unsealed and after thirty days, we can only return the item if there is a fault with it.

A woman comes in today with one of our own-brand headsets, saying that she bought it a couple of weeks ago and her son doesn't think that the sound quality is very good. My co-worker, we'll call her Jenny, politely tells this woman that we cannot return the headset unless there is an actual fault. Store policy. The customer, a Karen, then tells Jenny that ""there is a fault! The sound quality isn't good! It's crackly!""

Our own-brand headsets aren't great, I will admit that, but with headsets you often get what you pay for.

Jenny goes out back and tests this headset, as we do with all ""faulty"" items, and when she comes back and tells Karen that the headset sounds fine and that we can't return it, as expected, Karen does not like this.

She goes on to ask whether she can have her money back on a gift card, Jenny says no, company policy states that we cannot return an item unless it is faulty. Karen then accuses Jenny of calling her son a liar, refusing to entertain the idea that there might be a problem elsewhere with her son's console, i.e. his controller, his connection, etc. Jenny is calm during this, being polite and respectful, but Karen is having none of it. ""You're just calling my son a liar! Why would you call a fourteen-year-old a liar?""

Then my boss steps in; he (thank god) backs Jenny up, tells Karen the same thing Jenny told her, even when Karen brings out the ""so you'd rather lose a customer?"" card.

I don't really know how to finish this lol, but Karen eventually left, without her refund, after accusing us of taking advantage of children.

Another day in retail!"

The other day towards the beginning of my shift we got a call from a lady saying she lost a bank envelope with $1000 cash and thought it was in a shoebox she returned. We still had the cart with return items so boss and I found the shoebox and looked. Nothing. Those were the only shoes that matched the description. Boss apologized to her that we didn't find it. The lady didn't freak out too hard because she assumed that meant it HAD to be in her car.

Later that night I got another call from her sounding defeated. She had spent a few more hours looking for it with no luck. Everything had been sent to be restocked at this point so all I could do was take down her name and number for the slim chance someone found it and turned it in. There wasn't a lot of hope in either side of that conversation and I was sure that would be the end I heard of it.

In the last half hour of my shift today that had been swamped with payday craziness up walks a lady. She says she's been talking with our head of security and someone from corporate security, mentioning them both by name, and I should have an envelope with $1000 cash for her. I blurted ""Oh my God they found it?!?"" Before backtracking to explain I was the one on the phone so knew the shoebox saga. 

It ended up not being in my locked drawer so I had to get my boss (same one from the other day) to track it down. She was equally shocked, but got it handled and back to the lady. The envelope had zero personal information, but somehow some honest person found it and it made it's way home."

My sister in law makes home made soap. I sell the soap in our family owned shop that offers a variety of different types artistic media for purchase.

The soaps we were selling on this day this summer were fruit and horror themed.

Now this has never happened in my two years of selling soap.

We were offering a special type of soap for the week called a maple leaf. It was in the shape of a leaf and smelled like maple toddies.

Two girls walked in to look at the soap. Around twenty-ish and seemingly intelligent.

One of them picks up one of the maple leafs and smells of it. I go to tell her about what it's made out of, as I usually do because of skin sensitivity, and before I can say anything she just chomped it; plastic wrap and all.

I thought she would spit it out at least. She chewed and swallowed it, then turned to me complain it wasn't maple flavored.

I was dumbfounded. I told her she would still have to pay for it and she complained about it not being very good, but I managed to get her to pay for it before they both left.

I have no idea why that happened and haven't seen them since. Definitely one of my more bizarre encounters with a customer."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dd3hm4/for_the_love_of_jolly_ranchers/,"For The Love of Jolly Ranchers Alright, so this happened about 3 hours ago, and I'm starting to think this is the scariest, funniest, and infuriating thing that's ever happened to me all at once. So, we just got through clearing up the crowds in our store, and we're getting ready to lock up and do some maintenance cleaning and recovery when all of a sudden I hear knocking on the glass. There was a man that looked to be in his mid-twenties, so we'll go ahead and call him Grown Man (GM). I'll explain why his title maybe a little (or a lot) erroneous. 

> GM: Excuse me, Miss! Hey, excuse me! Open up, please!

> Me: *mouths* I'm sorry, we've already closed.

> GM: Come oooon, maaaan! I just need to get something in there real quick, PLEASE!

> Me: *(shaking head)* I really am sorry, Sir. We're closed.

> GM: *(a little louder this time, banging on the door)* COME OOOOON, PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! 

And that's when I shouted to my cool manager (CM) to come up front and tell this *boy* that we are closed, FOR REAL. 

> CM: I really am sorry, Sir. We're closed for the time being, but we open tomorrow at 6 am if you wanna come back.

> GM: *(starting to sound pitiful now)* COME OOOOOOOOON, PLEEEEASE! PLEASE OPEN UP! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! I JUST NEED TO GET ME SOME JOLLY RANCHERS REAL QUICK, PLEASE!

Ohhh, hold on a second, WHAT? All this ado...over JOLLY RANCHERS? CM and I looked at each other like he's completely lost it. I mean, there are 3 or 4 gas stations that are open around here that have Jolly Ranchers...but no. He wants to buy them from us...RIGHT AS WE'RE CLOSING. But he was just so dang pitiful that we had to open the door for him to get them or else he'll be there whining all night. And just like that, he finally paid for his Jolly Ranchers without a ""thank you"" or anything...but a sneered ""Some real women you both are. Bitches.""

Cue another dumbfounded glance shared between CM and I. It pissed off CM, but it scared *me* just a little. What if we kept him hanging like that? Would he go completely belligerent than he was then? We don't know. But now, it's sort of funny because as we were cleaning up and getting ready to head home after the whole ordeal, we had to shake our heads and laugh as we looked back on that encounter and think, ""Wow...a grown man throwing a fit...*over some Jolly Ranchers.*"""

I used to work at a small supplement store back when I first started college. We sold your usual vitamins and supplements as well as protein powders, workout supplements, essential oils, medicine, that kind of stuff.

We had this regular customer, let’s call him Albert, who came into the store about once a week. He was an older, retired gentleman whose wife was kind of sickly. He’d come every single month, around the same time, with a little red paper folder filled with pictures of the exact vitamins and medicines he needed to get for her. He’d show me a picture, we’d walk to where it was together, and do that about 3 more times, then he’d pay, leave a little peppermint candy for every person working that day, and leave. Then we’d see him again next month just like clockwork. He liked to tell the staff stories about all the places him and his wife have visited (he had no kids so him and his wife traveled the world for quite a few years). I loved this customer, everything he did was just adorable. And we knew whenever Albert was gonna grace us with his presence because this adorable, tiny old man drove a sweet red Ferrari. Bless you, sir. We all need an Albert in our retail careers."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dd1ris/apparently_the_store_i_work_in_is_a_good_place_to/,"Apparently the store I work in is a good place to sell drugs. So I usually work late night Thursday, because in Australia shops are open till late on Thursday’s. 
Well this particular Thursday seemed like it was going to be a really calm and quiet night. Little did I know apparently there was a drug deal going on in the store. 

There was a lady, two men and around two children. One of the men had nothing to do with the other man and the children but the lady was apparently buying drugs off him. 

Obviously we were not aware of this until the other man had a massive outburst and was screaming at the lady saying he was going to “f*cking kill her” and that “she was never going to see her kids again”. This man pushed his children out the store while continually yelling “ I’m going to f*cking kill you c*nt” and kept coming back to try and fight the other man. He was also yelling things like “you did it in front of the children, you’ve f*cking done it this time c*nt”. And when the kids left the store they threw down what they wanted to buy and said “quick let’s get out of here while we still can”. 

We called security but when I asked the lady if she was okay she told me that was her ex and he was crazy and if he comes back we should call the police. The security officer removed him from the store and the kids came back afterwards and bought nerf guns. 

We don’t really know what happened and what happened after that but the other man left a little while later and we assumed he was the dealer. 
(The reason we know it was a drug deal was because as the man left he said it to the lady at the front) 

So much for a quiet Thursday night."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dckzov/can_i_get_cash_back/,"""Can I get cash back?"" So I am a customer service manager at a grocery chain store. I was getting ready to leave for the day but still needed to help a cashier print something out, so I was waiting for her at the service desk (located right outside the office we needed to be in). 

The cast in the story is: Me-Me, Cashier 1- A, Cashier 2 - B, My fellow manager- CSM, Customer - C, Customer's Friend- CF

While I'm waiting for A to come up to the office, C walks up to the desk holding a pack of sunflower seeds.

C- ""Can I get cash back?""

Me- ""Yes, you can get cash back.""

C- ""Can I get just ten dollars?""

Me- ""No, twenty is the minimum.""

C- ""I can't get just ten?""

Me- ""No, it won't give you the option for less than twenty, but I can break down the twenty for you.""

C- ""So I couldn't get just ten?""

Me- ""I can do an unload on your card, but that has a $3.74 fee on it.""

C- ""I'll just do the twenty.""

Me- ""Okay.""



I log into the register and scan her sunflower seeds, then her friend comes up to her with a gallon of milk.

Me- ""Did you want to purchase this too?"" *Gestures to the milk.*

C and CF continue talking.

Me- ""Did you want to purchase the milk too?""

C- ""Not right now.""

Me- ""Okay. That'll be 52 cents.""

C- ""That's sixty."" *Hands me sixty cents.*

Me, slightly confused, cashes her out- ""Eight cents is your change.""

C- ""Oh, I was gonna get cash back."" 

Me- ""You have to use your card to get cash back.""

C- ""Okay."" Walks away.


By this point, my cashier had come up to the desk, so we go into the office to print out her papers. Then B calls me from the self check out.


B- ""Hey, there's a customer out here that said she paid for her sunflower seeds at the desk.""

Me- ""Yes, she did.""

B- ""Okay."" 


B hangs up, but then immediately call me back.


B- ""She said she's missing her cash back.""

Me- ""She has to use her card to get cash back. She paid cash, so she didn't get any.""

B- ""Okay.""


I finish helping A print her papers, so I come out of the office and walk up to the self check out podium where B is standing with C and CSM.


CSM- ""Do you have her receipt? She said she doesn't have it.""

Me- ""Yeah, I have it up there. I'll go get it.""


I walk back to the service desk and get her receipt out of the trash can. I turn and see that she had followed me, so I hand it to her. She then walks back to the self check out and speaks with CSM again. I walk back over because I can tell this isn't over.


CSM- ""Can you give her a refund? She wants to refund it to buy it again for cash back.""

Me- ""Okay, but you have to use your card to get cash back.""

C- ""Yeah, I was going to, but you just rang it up and did whatever you wanted.""


And I'm just standing there, like??? You gave me money to pay for your item. What did you expect me to do with that?? If you have me money, I am going to tell the register that you gave me money. But I just tell her that I can refund her at the service desk.


So we go up to the desk and I give her the $0.52 back. She takes the money and starts walking away.


Me- ""Do you want to ring it up for cash back?""

C, with an attitude- ""I'm going to do it over here at self checkout.""


I just thought to myself that the self check out is only going to give you a twenty back, and we won't be able to break that down for you, but okay.


I immediately clocked out and came home to rant to my roommates about her. I just don't understand where her confusion came from, and how she was going to blame me for cashing her out when she gave me money.


Tl;dr: Woman hands me money for her purchase, then gets mad at me for cashing her out when she wanted cash back."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dcch7u/ill_pay_in_cash/,"""Ill pay in cash"" LTL, FTP, etc etc.

I used to work as a cashier at a regional grocery store chain as a summer job this happened during a morning shift one day.

I was waiting around for a customer near my register when this guy rolls up with two carts full of groceries. No big deal but I knew I would be there for a while.

After I scanned all of his two carts worth of groceries it totaled somewhere just under 300 dollars worth.

I asked the generic cash or card question and he said cash and proceeded to hand me a massive stack of one dollar bills.

Knowing this was a ""unique"" case I called over my manager and we began counting and bundling the money to make sure he had enough. After counting the customer was still short another 100 dollars or so.

After telling the customer he was short he said he would ""be right back"" and about three or so minutes later came back into the store with another stack of ones.

After counting *those* he was still short like 50 bucks and we had to painstakingly go through his items and remove stuff he didn't need badly.

Thankfully it was early in the morning so he didn't hold up a line of people or anything and he was a nice enough dude.

My real question is why did he have so many ones? Where do you get that many? Money laundering?? I will never know.

&#x200B;

Edit: The money laundering comment was meant as a joke so dont take it too seriously."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dcenz8/the_time_i_outsmarted_a_shoplifter_at_the_fitting/,"The time I outsmarted a shoplifter at the fitting rooms So this happened a while back (maybe 6 months ago?) and I was still quite new to the job - definitely the newest store associate. 

Part of our standard practices is to *physically* check all items of clothing entering the fitting room although most associates do not do this out of fear that the customer feels accused, guilty, offended etc. Not me, I don't care. 

Now, if you work in retail, I'm pretty sure that you have had some sort of induction training and part of that is how to prevent/deter thefts without putting yourself in danger, without alerting/confronting the thief and safely too. 

Here's the story of how I did all of this to perfection (after the bold writing, the story is over, I'm just typing extra stuff after that:

**It was busy, on a Saturday. And I actually have a queue at the fitting room of about 5 people. The first guy comes up to me with 6 items (I even remember the number of items he had). But, he looks shifty in his body language, immediately I knew something was off about him. He looked smart though. He wore glasses, dressed well, looked about mid-20's and just looked innocent.**

**I count his items in, gave him a number tag for 6 items. He quickly takes it all from me and I told him ""Wait..."". I took a thick zipped hoodie off of him, unzipped the jumper and what do ya know? A Ralph Lauren shirt had been double-hung in the hoodie!! I then turned to him and said ""Do you want to try this on too?"" He said yes and I changed his tag to 7 items. He was embarrassed. The other customers looked at me just surprised that someone tried to pull this off, they definitely would have gone home to tell their SO about this.**

Ralph Lauren items are one of our most expensive brands in store. The ways I noticed it is by his body language, I knew he weren't about to switch the price tickets because he just seemed too smart for that. I also noticed the inside label of the jumper wasn't the same brand as the actual jumper and of course, the jumper seemed quite heavy. It was him who did it because the size of the shirt matched the sizes of everything else he had. He would have detagged that in the FR (they're really cheap to buy on eBay nowadays), stuffed it in his pocket (easy to do with a shirt) and walked out after dumping the security tag in the store somewhere, likely under a gondola. 

Others who work in stores with fitting rooms. The fitting room is a prime location for shoplifting. It is also a first point of contact for customers to interact with staff and develop an opinion of the store based on the staff interaction there. There are ways you can discreetly search an item of clothing quickly and the customer may notice, but it's better done discreetly and quickly than obnoxiously and to prove a point. In this instance, I didn't say ""Why are you stealing?"". I probably deterred this guy from trying it ever again and I remained professional about it too, other customers noticed this and it would have created a lasting, positive impression of my service to them. At the same time, I couldn't have done this without other customers noticing what I just did so my professionalism was integral. Remember, you can always deter theft and still provide a good customer service. My managers loved me after this."

I sell fish and it goes by weight. But if it's a recipe, it will go by unit. 

So:

WEIGHT: Salmon: $5/LBS

UNIT: Salmon into Spinach Roll: $6.99 PER ROLL 

Which means if you want a ROLL you will be paying $6.99. Doesn't matter how much it weighs.

A customer tried to argue with me today. ""Oh but what is the price per weight?""

I explained that for a recipe we don't count the weight and go by unit. He was having none of this. ""But what's the weight? How much in kilograms? How much in pounds? That doesn't sound right! It should be less!""

 Finally I gave up.  I didn't care to have a bad day so I basically said ""Here you are sir, TWO recipes for the price of one!"" (I gave him both of the recipes for $6.99 even though the total was over $13)

 . . . He comes back and asks for another 2 salmon rolls. Like do you really think I'm this stupid? I was just being nice. I give him the next two salmon rolls for full price.  $13 bucks. 

""Oh you charged me too much! $13 dollars??""

""Yup. The full amount. Because it goes by unit and not weight. It's what I've been telling you""

""  . ..  but, but? ""  
""No just walk away. Bye""

. . . and then it got returned. Because he couldn't argue his way out of paying what he was actually supposed to pay."

I was working a normal part-time 4-9 pm. shift on a Friday.  When later in the evening, around 7-8 pm. enters a customer. (woman in her late 40)  Asking if we had any more left of a particular red wine that was a Friday only sale. I tell the customer to give me a few minutes as I go down to the store basement where we keep the stock and check our 4 big pallets with wine. Sadly for the customer, there's no red wine, but a lot of white and rosé. Then I come to think of a pallet standing at the front of the store packed with the same brand that was on sale that day, and I immediately call our customer service to check if there were any red wines left on that pallet. But then again, no red but a lot of red and rosé. 

I then walk out to the customer and bring her the sad news that, since she got here late there were no red wine left of that brand to such a good price but politely suggest that we have white wine or rosé of the same brand for the same price. She doesn't want the white or rosé and is set to get the red wine, to which I again politely tell her that we're out of stock. At first, she seems to accept that she go to the store late, and we were all out of stock. Again I apologise to her and say the goodbyes, but the goodbye is what has been puzzling me for years now, and still is to this day. the conversation went as followed

Me: I'm sad to inform you that we're all out of the red wine

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Me: But I do certainly hope that you have a wonderful evening nonetheless

 Customer: Well, I can't have a good evening now that you've ruined it all for me.

Me: (I nervously giggle, not quite knowing what to say, I then muttered)  Unfortunately it seems so.

OL = Old Lady  
C = Coworker  
Me = Minecraft Enderman

I work at a popular grocery store in New Zealand, in a small town with a large retirement village, which means that a large population of this little town is old people. And old people seem to invade the grocery store after their favourite old-people activities: Like golf, and yelling at the poor min-wage employee.

So, it begins with me, I stock the shelves on the aisles that need to be stocked (all of them) today I was working down the aisle which contained Pasta, Soups, and Sauces. I was stocking the shelves from my trolley of boxes, and OL approaches me asking where *x* item was, with a smile I told her the location of the item, and that was that. Or so I thought, because two minutes later, C comes around the corner with OL in tow, she asks me if I can find '*x*' for this lady. She cuts C off by saying ""Don't speak to him, he's useless."" Totally ignoring that bombshell, I tell C where the item is found, and that seemed to be the end of it.

I'm an assistant manager at a fairly well known shoe store. We work a 2/2 coverage so there's only 2 people working at any time. Near the end of my closing shift it gets BUSY. And while the front is packed with customers that the other manager is handling, I'm running around trying to finish putting away 30+ boxes of shipment that we got for the day, switching styles on the floor, and doing shoe fill. Clearly very busy, and trying to avoid eye contact with customers. 

A couple comes in and spends the whole time in our clearance section that is just a shelf of display shoes. If they need a size, we have to go track it down for them. 

It was starting to clear out at that point and the other manager wasn't nearly as busy as me. Of course, the couple keeps yelling for me to go grab sizes for them. (By sizes, I mean they just say ""something smaller""). It's fine, I'm quick and it doesn't take up too much time. We only have one other size for each of the shoes they want anyway because it's years old stuff we're trying to get rid of. 

When I bring them out, I very clearly tell them that it's the only size we have apart from the too big display shoes. One fits, the other is a size too big. They spend the next half hour with the girl walking around in the big shoes and yelling ""please, a smaller size"" at me. I had to go back FIVE TIMES and make a show of looking for a shoe that doesn't exist. Each time I come back and remind them it's the last pair because they're old and we don't make them any more. 

Ended up having to stay way late, and they bought the big shoes. (I heard them ask the other manager for another size as well at checkout). 

I was thrilled."

(Which means if the person behind her, like 97% of customers, is dumb enough to not understand how a moving belt works, then I'm going to end up getting their groceries mixed in with Weirdo's groceries. *thankfully this doesn't happen*) She apparently fully expected someone else to put their items on the belt, too! She had maybe 2 items on the belt and then put a divider behind her items.

I start scanning, and like the belt does, everything moves forward. I grab the divider and place it back in it's notch and continue scanning.  
Weirdo still has ~10 items in her cart when she grabs another divider, places it on the belt and then places items behind it.

They were around 12-13 years old. They had pooled their money together to buy it, and they were excited to use it.

Not ten minutes later, an older man comes storming into our store demanding to speak with our manager. She wasn’t there that day so our ASM took over. The man began yelling at him over selling the Ouija board, especially to kids.

That’s when we noticed he had the board in his hands (opened) and the kids were by the door looking scared. The man continued to yell saying he had lost family members to the board, that he was an apostle, and that he would get our store shut down for selling Ouija boards. He demanded we tell our corporate to never sell these again, and he would be back to make sure.

He threw the board onto the counter and left. The kids came in and explained that they had gone down to the food court and were going to use it, but the man came out of nowhere and started yelling at them about how it’s evil and he took the board from them and demanded to know where they bought it at.

The ASM was willing to refund them their money (even though it was against store policy to due cash returns), since they didn’t want the board anymore. They didn’t want to do the return and said they would see if one of their brothers/cousins ( I don’t remember which) would take it; but left it at the store. We held it for several days but no one came for it.

Luckily we haven’t had to deal with that man again despite occasionally seeing him in the mall. I still feel bad for those kids losing their money like that, as our store manager ended up damaging out the board after a week.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dbujvy/youre_not_my_servant/,"You’re not my servant First post here - an older story from when I was a bagger at a grocery store. Dialogue is approximate at best.

It’s customary for the baggers at my store to ask people wih larger orders if they need help bringing their purchases to their cars. Generally you’d ask as you finish bagging the order, after the cashier has finished taking payment so there’s no interrupting going on.

Well, one day I was bagging a large order and was waiting for my turn to speak. The customer (let’s say Sally) was actively chatting with the cashier, so I wasn’t keen on interrupting. Then without missing a beat, Sally turns to look at me. She uses the flattest, least friendly voice possible when speaking to me, a far cry from how she addressed the cashier.

Sally: “You’re going to help me out, *right*?”
Me: “Of course.”
Sally: “That’s what I tought.”

I was a bit taken aback, but it was hardly the worst I had dealt with. Until I start to follow her out with the cart of groceries. You see, our front end is very busy during prime time and there’s only enough room for two people side by side. So in the interest of not blocking opposite traffic, people walk single file. We didn’t even make it 10 steps before Sally stops, turns around, and gives me a stink eye.

Sally: “Don’t walk behind me. You’re not my servant!”
Me: “Sorry, miss. I’m just following you.”
Sally: “Well don’t stand right behind me.”
Me: “Ma’am, there’s no room to walk anywhere else but behind you.”

She seemed satisfied with that answer and kept walking. Once we got to her car, she made it abundantly clear that I was to place the bags in a very specific manner in her trunk. She would roll her eyes every time I went to place a bag and then tell me to move it to a different area of the trunk. By the time I had loaded all of the bags, I was mentally drained. She closed her trunk and got into her car without saying a word of thanks and sped off as soon as I was out of the way.

I never saw her in the store again and I can’t say that I’m disappointed."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dc3k3t/1_2wait_whats_next_i_cant_count/,"1, 2...wait, what’s next? I can’t count So I work at a retail (borderline tourist) store that mainly sells clothing and shoes. One day, this older couple came in to shop around. Let’s call the man Tourist Husband (TH) and his counterpart Tourist Wife (TW). They made me dislike them almost immediately. I overhear TW talking about a brand of shirt we have and how great the price is because she usually buys them for $89 but we have them for half that. As a college student that’s working part time for $8.50/hr that makes me annoyed because who has that kind of money to throw away on mediocre shirts? Meanwhile, TH keeps asking me self-explanatory questions and and to get my attention, he keeps referring to me as “little lady” and “little miss.” I’m not sure if it’s just me, but that seems degrading. 

After an hour, they finally decide to check out and I’m so relieved because I don’t want to deal with them any longer. They end up buying a lot and the total is around $250. TH pulls out his wallet and decides to pay with 20s and 10s, which I don’t have a problem with until he hands it to me and I count it (as I’m supposed to do) and he’s $20 short. And so I tell him this. He laughs a little and makes a joke I don’t remember and hands me a 20. So, as I’m supposed to, I recount all the money with the new bill. TW says, “You don’t have to count it, you know it’s the right amount.” Before I can explain, I finish counting BUT! One of the bills got stuck behind another so I’m confused as to why it’s $20 short again. I start counting the money for a third time because I need to make sure it’s the right amount, but TW starts talking about how I can’t count, which makes it hard for me to focus on counting so it takes EVEN longer to do it. Meanwhile, a whole line is forming behind them, this is how long it’s taking. 

Finally, I confirm it’s the right amount, input how much they gave me into the computer, and open the register. When you do this, the computer will automatically tell you the change you need to give back. In this case it ended up being something around $2.67. So I look at the screen, grab the bills, then look at the screen again to check the change (I’m not great at remembering numbers so I always double check to make sure I’m right). TW scoffs at me. Literally scoffs-I didn’t think that was an actual thing real people did until now-She scoffs at me and says, “you know, girls like you used to not have a machine to help them out. They had to calculate the change themselves.” I pause for a split second before biting down on my tongue so I don’t say anything to get me in trouble. I just had them their change and wait to serve the next customer. As they walk off, TH says, “thanks little lady” and I think I almost exploded."

I've had my fair share of really nice and respectful customers there, but there are those kinds of customers that really regret your decision to get a job. This is one of those stories. Anyway, on with the story.

So, it was a Sunday and for those who work in retail, you know Sundays are usually the busiest days of the week. So, I was in the express lane that day and I had a really long line. I was trying to get through every customer as fast as I could because people were getting impatient that the service was slow and there were long lines. We don't have enough cashiers to be able to open more lanes. So, anyway, I was serving a customer when I noticed in the corner of my eye, I saw an old man just standing there. He was there for a good few minutes and i wanted to see what he needed. So, as soon as I finished serving this customer, i turned to him and asked, ""How can I help you?"" This guy handed me a used lottery ticket. I kinda looked and gave him the ""what do you want me to do with this?"" face. He then said,"" I want my money."" I guess he just assumed I can cash the ticket for him because, in the store that I work at, there's a register right next to the first express lane where we cash in lottery tickets. We also keep balloons and cigarettes in the same register. I in no way was able to cash in the ticket because I just don't know how to and only a manager or assistant manager is able to do so. I explain this to the old man and he gave me a dirty look like how dare this teenager working minimum wage tells me that they can't cash in this ticket and a manager has to do it. He then leaves and I continue to serve more customers. Not even two minutes later, this rude boi comes back while I was still in the process of a transaction. As soon as I finish, he completely ignored the long line of customers waiting to check out and walked up to me and demanded a pack of cigarettes. He pointed at the brand and pack he wanted (I honestly don't remember the brand, I don't smoke). Anyway, I scanned it and I told him the total (I decided not to ID him because he was obviously well over 21, the legal age to buy cigarettes, at least in my state, I don't know if every state is changing the legal age or not). This man places a bunch of change in the counter. Before I was finished counting the change, he just leaves the store with no warning. He was maybe a dollar short. I called my manager and told her about the situation. She said they'll make a report of the man and she canceled the transaction. I continued to serve customers and I was already in a bad mood because of what happened. I haven't seen that old man ever since. I don't know what happened or he got banned from the store. I just honestly hope that guy learned how to be nicer to people."

Early last year, we started charging for plastic and paper bags, and as part of a promotion we gave away free reusable bags. 1 bag per every 25$ spent. They are plastic based but I've seen customers use the same bag for years and years. They're proper reusable bags and not just slightly thicker plastic - and they hold more than a regular disposable bag too.

Customer comes through our till spends $55. I start up my spiel. 

Me - Hey! Just a heads up we are starting to charge for plastic and paper bags. We are giving away reusable bags for the next two weeks with certain purchases.  You'd be getting two free bags with this purchase.

Customer - Can I see them?

Me - Of course, [I grab the bags and hold them out to her]

C - But these are plastic.

Me - They're reusable. I've had mine for two years and its held up well.

C - Yeah but... These are plastic.

[At this point my coworker, J, comes up]

J - They're reusable, and free. 

C - I don't want them, they're plastic.

Me - Okay! Would you like me to put these in a disposable paper bag instead?

C - I don't like paper. Give me a normal bag.

Me - Like... a plastic bag? [I reach down and grab a single use bag.]

C - Of course. Are they biodegradable?

J - N..no? They're plastic. They break down into smaller plastics but don't biodegrade. You'd be better off taking the free reusable bag.

C - Oh. I was hoping they were compostable.

Me - Do you want the reusable bag then?

C - Absolutely not. Its PLASTIC.

And she walked off, an eco-warrior with three disposable plastic bags in tow."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dbk4mc/i_was_on_my_hands_and_knees_looking_at_the_price/,"I was on my hands and knees looking at the price I manage the front end/sometimes the entire grocery store. Monday is normally the day I make up/type in the schedule so I'm not on the floor a whole lot. I had just bought my lunch and was walking back upstairs when a cashier called me over to help. I don't mind really, most issues I can fix in a few seconds. Customer had grabbed the 30 pack of toilet paper which was $20.99 instead of the 22 pack that was on sale for $8.99. A sale that big has a lot of people buying so off the top of my head I already knew he had grabbed the wrong one.

Me = me. CM = Confused Man. SD = Service Desk Employee.

Me: ""Sorry you grabbed the wrong one, the one on sale is the 22 pack, do you want me to run and grab it for you?""

CM: ""Oh ok yeah thats fine.""

Now I'm not entirely sure what happened between when I left and came back but his mood had shifted. The cashier is the nicest, quietest middle-aged lady who I honestly don't think is capable of speaking in anything louder than a loud whisper.

Me: ""Ok here's the right one, this one is the $8.99 one.""

CM: ""No I want this one for $15.99, I know I saw the price with my own two eyes.""

The regular price of the 22 pack is $15.99 but it's got a big tag on it that says $8.99 so there's actually no toilet paper over there for $15.99.

Me: ""I was just over there and this one is for 30 rolls $20.99 and this one with 22 rolls is $8.99, I'll put the 30 pack in for $15.99 but the $8.99 one is still the better value."" (I agreed to put in anyway just to get him out)

CM: ""I was on my fucking hands and knees trying to read that tag and I know what I fucking saw""

Me: ""Ok I told you I would put it in if you wanted it, do you want the 30 pack for $15.99?""

CM: ""Yes I do.""

So I put it in and walk away. If you thought the story was over, just you wait. He has 3 gift cards, 2 of them only have a few dollars and the third one has the full $50. So he puts in the first two and still has $18 left to pay for the rest of his stuff. I had ALMOST made it to the staircase to go upstairs when I hear the cashier saying ""Sir! Sir! you havent finished paying yet!"" So because shes probably already horrified and confused by this guy I figure I might as well go tell this guy to finish paying. He had stopped at the service desk so while he's there I go up to him and say

Me: ""Sir when you're done here you have to go back to the register, you payment didn't complete.""

CM: ""What the fuck do you think I'm doing here I'm paying for my stuff right here""

Me: ""No this is the service desk you can't pay here, you have to pay for the items at the register it was rung up on.""

Now the service desk employee is very confused because she then turns to him and says

SD: ""All you told me to do was check the balance on your gift card, you have $50 on it. You can't pay here.""

CM: ""Why can't I pay here? This is a register is it not?!""

Me: ""Well yes but you didn't ring up your items here, your order is on register 4, you need to pay over there.""

CM: ""This makes no fucking sense I just want to pay for my items""

Me: ""You used two gift cards on register 4, you can use that one to pay for the rest of it.""

He then proceeded to walk past the register he was supposed to go to and then I had to remind him AGAIN that he was supposed to go to register 4.

I just wanted to eat my lunch."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/db96wj/your_pocket_is_moving/,"Your pocket is moving. So we need this one. I used to work the service counter at a trucking company. One day, a driver comes in to drop off his truck. Dude is HUGE. Not fat, muscles. Like if the truck broke down, the load would be on time anyways. He had to turn sideways to go through the door.

I'm setting up his appointment and he's got a foot long sandwich in his hand, which he's eating as we're talking. Politely, but eating. At one point, he's got a few questions to answer so the sandwich is stationary. His shirt pocket started to move. Out pops the fluffiest Pomeranian I've ever seen. Pup's trying to get the sandwich but there just isn't enough of him to reach. Guy noticed me watching and looked down. ""Awwww. Want some, Cujo?"" and tears a chunk off. Dog takes it and retreats into the pocket.

I mean, who calls a Pom ""Cujo""?  Guy apologizes that he brought the pup in. I inform him our rule is pets can be brought in if they are under control. Clearly, he is, so he's welcome. 

Driver went to the office and came back later as we're finishing his truck. Cujo got taken out to meet me and he's sniffing around my counter.  My supervisor comes out, first seeing this giant taking up both our waiting chairs. The he sees Cujo. ""What the...?""  Arf! Arf! My supervisor said it explained the dog hair in the cupholder.

 Driver came back another time before I got downsized. Cujo plumped up to 3 pounds!

Only goes to show you, not to judge."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dbgqxr/no_no_i_dont_want_to_move_in_with_an_attempted/,"No, No, I Don't Want to Move in With An Attempted Shoplifter... So, at the store where I work, there's usually only one cash register open at a given time, and on the night in question, I was running it. From said register, you can see the three other main registers - our backup, the one in the beauty department, and the one in photo. Our beauty register has a lot of free samples in cabinets, but you wouldn't know they were there without looking in areas a customer shouldn't be. Also, right next to the register, there's a mini endcap with a bunch of travel size beauty products, mostly smaller versions of the things we sell in regular sizes. 


So it's a busy weekend night at my store, and it's just myself, a shift manager, and maybe a second shift manager. We've been a little shorthanded when it comes to weekend nights lately. I'm checking people out when my shift manager (we'll call her Melanie) pings me on our walkies.


Melanie: Hey, Me, there's a blonde woman in beauty who's prowling around the register area. She's taken one of the beauty bags and it looks like she's filling it up with samples, which is okay, but check it when you check her out, okay?

Me: Copy that. I'll look out for her.


The ""beauty bags"" are higher quality versions of our regular bags that don't fall apart with a mild breeze or if you look at it wrong. If we check people out on the beauty register, we usually use them, but they're not anywhere else in the store. No one had used the beauty register all day, so seeing one of the beauty bags in use would be a very unusual thing.


No more than fifteen minutes or so later, the blonde woman (we'll call her Sara) came up front to check out with a basket bulging with clearance beauty items and a distinctly drug-addled-adjacent (aka, I'm not sure if she was high or not, but she certainly seemed it) demeanor about her. 


As I'm scanning her items, she starts to talk about her divorce. And her three daughters, who most of these items are for. And how I'm apparently about the same age as her daughters. (That wouldn't surprise me, although I'm also probably older than she realizes.) Honestly, I'm just trying to get through the transaction, because I know that eventually, I'm going to have to ask her about the tiny little elephant in the room - the beauty bag sitting next to her basket. And I'm not ready for that conversation.


So, finally, she's ready to pay. And then I hold up the beauty bag. 


Me: Can I look in this, please? 

Sara: Oh, sure! It's just a bunch of samples, but I understand!
 

So I start going through it. Most of it is samples, for sure, but there's also a few expensive perfume testers and a couple of travel-sized items from the mini endcap. (And, not that I was going to say anything, but, uh, if she was looking for the good samples, she missed them.)


Me: Ma'am, these are testers, they're not samples or for sale and I can't give them to you. And, uh, these lotions are for sale, they're not samples.

Sara: Oh my God, okay, that's fine! I thought they were all free samples! I was going to give those to my daughters, because we don't have anything fun right now, but if you can't, that's fine! (Because spending over $100 on clearance beauty items isn't ""fun"" enough, I guess.)


Right. At this point, I'm determined to get her out the door and move on with my night, because something about this doesn't feel right. She pays, leaves, and I breathe a sigh of relief. At least the next customers in line are nice, normal, and exactly what I expect from a weekend night like that. 


Until she comes back in the store about 5-10 minutes later. And then that's when it takes a turn toward the bizarre, jumps the guardrail, and goes careening off the cliff.


Sara: So! I wanted to ask you a question.

Me: *internally* Oh God, what could she possibly want.

Sara: I told you how I was getting a divorce, right?

Me: Yeah, you might have mentioned something about it.

Sara: I was thinking...do you want to move in with me into my spare room? I can't afford my giant house all by myself.

Me: ....What?

Sara: Yeah, I have a spare room, you seem like a nice girl, move in with me, then I can afford to stay and I'm sure it's nicer than wherever you live on a (Store) paycheck.

Me: ....Yeaaaaaaaah, uh, no, sorry, I'm okay, though. Thanks.


The customer I was helping at that point kept laughing about it. And then the next time I saw said customer (let's call her Dana), she asked me about it.


Dana: So, whatever happened to that crazy lady that asked you to move in with her?

Me: *shrugs* I never saw her again after that night. That literally came out of nowhere, so I don't know why she was asking it.

Customer's teenage daughter's jaw was scraping the ground. 

Dana: Oh, I felt so bad for you that night, but you handled it so well. Better than I would have. I would have slapped her.


And the three of us laughed and they went on their way. I hope I never see Sara again, but I'll always remember her as the customer who tried to make her cashier her roommate. Sheesh. The only roommate I want right now has four legs, a tail, and is currently curled up at my feet dreaming of salmon treats."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dbnw6n/my_brief_stint_as_an_improvised_security_detail/,"My brief stint as an improvised security detail This happened a couple of weeks ago, but it's my crown moment in the year and a half I've been working at this grocery store.

This is a store that also sells tobacco products at the customer service counter where the only way in or out is a door that says ""EMPLOYEES ONLY PLEASE"". For the sake of convenience, we don't always keep that door locked; not every cashier has a key, and plenty of customers will ask for smokes at the register with their other stuff. Also, it's not in a very nice neighborhood, to put it politely.

It's a slow Saturday night with myself, two other cashiers, and one woman working the customer service desk and also acting supervisor. For this story, I'm calling her Stella(S).

A drunk junkie(DJ) stumbles around the front of the store, with an open cold one in hand. Obviously grabbed from the beer aisle. He's obviously drunk and any cop would charge him for public intoxication.

S: Excuse me sir, what are you doing with that beer in your hand?

DJ stumbles his way to the service desk, and through the open door, goes for a pack of cigarettes.

S: You cannot be in here! You need to leave now! Give me that beer and get out!

It takes a more sober customer blocking the only way in to convince DJ to leave. Stella calls the police to let them know what's going on.

Stella then tells me to take my break and make sure DJ doesn't try anything until the law shows up.

I just hang out by the front doors watching him pace around. Next thing I know, he darts past me, knocking my phone out of my hand.

I chase after him shouting ""MOTHERFUCKER!"" I end up grabbing him around his waist and keeping a good hold on him. But let me tell you...dude put up one hell of a fight. I tried to put him into a particular hold(not sure what it's called, but it's where you wrap your arms around your opponent's from behind and then lace your fingers behind their neck) that was tricky to do given how much he was moving, and also the fact that he's skinnier and taller than me (I'm about 5'7 or 170cm). The main issue I had was getting him to hold still. But I digress.

DJ: You don't understand! They're coming after me! They're trying to kill me!

Me(having none of it): You done fucked up now, boy. Get the fuck out.

S(like a parent that gets annoyed when the kids are roughhousing): Irraanos, you're gonna end up getting hurt.

It ends up taking me and two other guys with a lot more heft than me to drag him out the door for a second time. Luckily, the cops were just pulling up and they put the cuffs on him in a heartbeat.


Addendum: I'm not a martial artist by any stretch of the imagination. No formal training, I just have an older brother who used to wrestle with me all the time. I'm also not a thrill seeker. But I do need to confess one thing. The adrenaline rush that I got from this whole thing was A W E S O M E. News of what I did spread pretty quickly, with most reactions being either shock or applause. I also found out from a co-worker at my other job(different store chain entirely) that one of the guys that helped me drag DJ out was her brother. I owe that guy some drinks."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dbirsr/we_love_long_lines/,"We love long lines! I work in inventory in a very large chain grocery store.

Today, front end must have had a lot of sick calls or there was an unanticipated rush, because there were some rather long line ups. I was walking back to the office when a woman in line stops me. I recognize her as a serial complainer.

**Woman:** Excuse me, you need to open more cashes. There are very long lines.

**Me:** I can't open more cashes, I'm not in charge there. I could mention it to the front end supervisor.

**Woman:** Yes, you should.

**Me:** I will, but I'm sure if we had any free cashiers they would be in their lanes by now.

The woman just gives me a look, like 'but I noticed and mentioned something therefore it should be changed.'

I resist the urge to roll my eyes and turn around to head to customer service, where I see the supervisor.

**Me:** Hey, \[Supervisor\], a customer thinks you should open more cash lanes.

The supervisor rolls her eyes and makes some fed-up guttural throat noise. I've betrayed her by being a colleague and coming to her with such a stupid request.

**Supervisor:** Yeah, I'd LOVE to if I COULD.

**Me:** Hey, I know, but I had to come over to talk to you because *the customer is watching me*.

At this, the supervisor looks at me, then smiles and laughs. I've not betrayed her after all, I'm just keeping up appearances with difficult customers. She rushes off and I turn to head back to the office, and sure enough I see the customer has edged away from her cart to stand in a spot where she can watch me, making sure I didn't ignore her. I quickly look away and take a different route to the office because I'd a feeling she'd have more demands of me if I were to get too close.

Oh, I should mention, she was waiting in the self-scan lineup. We have a finite number of those, they're all always on unless they're broken, and one employee works all of them. So she was complaining for... Not even her own benefit?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dblnz2/our_stores_infestation/,"Our Store’s Infestation I’ve posted here before but to reiterate I work for a decently sized chain of farm stores. Since we are a farm store, we sell feed for basically any animal other than fish. 

For background, about a year ago we received a truck of feed from my DC that was infested with mice. We didn’t know until the pallets were in the store and they started scattering into different corners of the store. 

Fast forward to present, we’ve had multiple exterminators come almost weekly, but none have been able to make much of a difference and the mice have learned where to hide and repopulate. 

So, about a week ago when I was closing with two other people, it was about 30 minutes to close and I was working on returns (i.e. reshelving ones that weren’t damaged and writing out broken or defective merchandise). One of the things I need to reshelve were a pair of muck boots (basically an expensive, $140, pair of rubber swamp boots). I went over to the shelf and noticed another box had a bit of cardboard chewed off of it around the hole commonly found on shoe boxes to grab them easier. I sighed, realizing that a mouse probably got in it and chewed part of the box to make nesting. What I wasn’t prepared for was to pull the box down, open it and find piles of cardboard and tissue paper chewed into small shreds for nesting. I was so immune to it at that point that I just thought that a mouse had gotten busy, but wasn’t expecting that she was using it as a home. 

Grossed out, I pulled out the first boot only for momma mouse, her family and living space to follow suit. I poured them into the box, thank heavens. But then momma mouse decides to jump straight at me in an attempt to get away from me! I scream and back up watching momma run away, leaving behind her home for me to take care of. I pick up the box and immediately notice 2 naked, wriggling, pink baby mice scooting themselves around the box. 

The cashier I was working with at this point asked me what was up and I took the box over to her. We were both shocked and double checked the floor of the store to make sure no one was going to see the orphans. I searched for a pair of gloves to use so I could grab the babies keep them under control. Putting them on, I moved the nesting around and the babies started multiplying. Two turned into four, then five, then ended at eight total babies. Neither of us knew what to do with them, so we ended up just calling our manager over so he could look at the scene too. 

In the end, I had to just throw them into the dumpster we had put back. I’ve seen momma in the same area a few times after all that happened. She had chewn through the boots she had her babies in and that pair was around $160. So, I don’t necessarily feel bad for her, but I still wonder if she’s alive somewhere in the store."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dbe9om/you_didnt_remove_the_sensor_tag/,"""You didn't remove the sensor tag!"" I'm currently working part time in a small clothing brand in my country. Also, theft and crime rates are pretty low and not something common here either. 

This clothes store has every single clothing on display tagged with a sensor tag and walking pass the sensor gates triggers it pretty easily because of how sensitive it is. A few days ago, someone stole a shirt worth $19.90 (cheapest item in the store) and our CCTV caught a child taking the shirt and running right out of the store. It so happened that it was a crowded day since it's a weekend and the staff on duty assumed that someone walked pass the sensor gates, accidentally triggering it. We only realised it at the end of the day when we were tidying up and realised a shirt was missing. The company didn't do much about it because it was cheap and simply sent out a warning to all staffs to be more careful.

Little did we know they would come back to the SAME store (we have 5 stores across the city, not far from each other).

Today, while I was serving some customers, a family of 5 walked in and triggered the sensor gates. This also happens sometimes with things bought from other stores. I brushed it off, didn't think much about it and went ahead to greet them.

They were in the store for awhile, trying on several clothing and ended up buying a TOTAL of $260++ worth of clothing. As they were about to pay, the father suddenly passes us the SAME shirt that was stolen and says, ""Oh, we bought this a while ago and you didn't remove the sensor tag, remove it! ""

I looked at the shirt, looked at my manager, looked at the customer and had this dumbfounded look on my face (we don't often sell display sets due to high quantities in our storeroom). My manager looks at them, snickers and sarcastically says, ""This looks just like the shirt that got stolen a while back, I'll remove it for you!"" 

Then somehow, I think it hit them that we have CCTVs and stock takes... 

Long story short, they ended up apologising PROFUSELY and offered to pay for it along with their other $260 worth of clothes. 

Weirdest experience I ever had working in retail."

For those who don't know, most glass screen protectors for iPhones come with a plastic guide you can use to make sure the glass is lined up right. It's not useful for any other purpose, so we typically throw it away with the rest of the trash.

Today a customer came in and asked if my supervisor was in. He was not, so I offered to assist. This is _approximately_ how the conversation went.

Me: ""What can I do for you.""

Customer: ""`$supervisor` forgot to put the plastic thing and the cleaning cloth back in my box. Can you find that for me?""

Me: ""We typically throw those out once we're done with them...""

Customer: ""Well I paid for it, I want it.""

Obviously it's not in the garbage anymore, so I grab another supervisor.

Sup: ""Do you need it for anything?""

Customer: ""Well I paid for it, I want it.""

This was her _only_ reasoning. She didn't have a use in mind for it, it wasn't for an art project. She just paid money for it, so it needed to be in her posession.

As dumb as this is, she's not ^(_technically_) wrong. So we had to find the last of that exact screen protector and remove it from stock. So she could have her useless piece of plastic (and the little cloth).

You paid for the plastic packaging too. Want us to hold that for you as well?

At least she wasn't nasty about it."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/dbifkn/you_dont_sell_viagra/,"You don’t sell viagra?! I’m enjoying my day off, and was telling my husband about a short but very weird interaction from my last closing shift. 

Our store is a popular chain in the US, we also have a pharmacy in the back that is open limited hours each day. 

Anyway, right before closing a man walked in and headed straight to the back of the store. I assumed he was going to the pharmacy so I let him know it had closed at 6, but he shook his head and just kept walking. 

I was about to go upstairs to the office when my cashier walked up to me with a puzzled look on her face. 
She told me to look down the main aisle. When I walked around to the aisle she was pointing at, the man who had walked in minutes before was motioning for me to get over there. 
It was....weird, if that makes sense? This guy just seemed off and I couldn’t pinpoint what his deal was quite yet. 
I walked back to where he was and he finally speaks! But all he says is “come here” even though I was in a normal speaking distance away from him. Then I started to get uncomfortable. I asked him what he was looking for and he whispered “viagra” and stepped closer. 
Viagra?!
I had to be the bearer of bad news (although this whole thing just felt like he had to be joking) and let him know he needed to see his dr and get a prescription for that medication. It is definitely NOT an OTC we sell, or anyone sells OTC in the US. 

He just got a confused look on his face and stepped even closer (god I can’t stand it when people don’t have a sense of personal space, especially in THIS interaction) and just said “but he told me I could buy it here!”

I just repeated what I had already told him, and asked if there was anything else he was shopping for. 
His response was to squeeze my shoulder as he walked past muttering “but he told me I could buy it here” over and over. 

I guess it’s difficult to convey in words. But again, the whole interaction just felt so off. 
He had to be no older than 22, MAYBE 25 at the oldest. 

If you read my last post from the same day, you’ll agree that day was just weird all around. 
Usually the most uncomfortable interaction I have, which isn’t really that awkward on the scale of things, is helping a frantic single dad pick out what kind of pads his teenage daughter needs. 

Guess I was the bearer of bad news for that poor guy. Ruined his Saturday night!"

I've been there for about three months and oh man, do I have a lot of customer stories. For all of the cashiers out there, you're going to relate to this story in a way.

There was one time where there was a lady that came into my lane and was buying a couple of groceries. So anyway, I was charging for the items she had and one of the items was a pineapple. So, you know how some produce is charged by weight and not quantity? Well, this woman thought each pineapple was $1 per one. So, I typed the PLU code for pineapple in the register and it charged for $3, considering each pound was $1. For those who don't know or have never worked in a grocery store, in order to charge a produce item, we have to type a four-digit code (PLU code) for the item the customer wants to buy.  When she saw the price on the screen, she said, ""I thought the pineapple was a dollar."" I responded, ""The pineapple goes by the pound. It's a dollar per pound. This pineapple weights three pounds, therefore it's three dollars."" This lady just stood there as if she didn't understand what I just said for like a minute. I repeated what I said twice to get her to understand. She then said, ""Well, can't you just change the price to a dollar just this once for me?"" I told her no and she flipped out. Then, she asked to see the manager. All I just told her that the manager will tell you the same thing, but she insisted. So, I call for the manager and continued to scan the rest of her items while we waited. After a few minutes, she got even more upset and said, ""Nevermind, I don't want it. I'm not paying $3 for a pineapple."" Thanks, lady for wasting my time and holding the up the line. I hope I never see you here again.

This was my first post in this subreddit, I hope you liked this short story. I plan on posting more stories here about rude customers. What are some of your worst customers stories? Let me know.

Edit: Thanks to a commenter, I did forget to clarify what PLU stands for. It stands for Price Look-Up for the folks who have never worked in a grocery store. Sorry about that."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/db4quc/screen_protector_did_its_job/,"Screen Protector Did Its Job! I work at a cell phone retail store. Someone came in and complained that they purchased a tempered glass screen protector (the kind with a lifetime manufacturer guarantee) and it CRACKED when she dropped it, so she wanted her money back. 

After multiple times of trying to explain to the customer that this is the PURPOSE of glass screen protectors (seeing as her actually SCREEN wasn’t broken), I tried a different tactic and suggest she do a warranty claim with the manufacturer,  but I get cut off multiple times and she says she will just “sit there until [she] gets [her] money back,” to which I’m like “that’s fine but we close in an hour, so I’d have to kick you out then.” 

After multiple times back and forth, I finally got out that I can’t return a broken screen protector, but if she gets it replaced by the manufacturer then I can take THAT one back, and she was like “why didn’t you tell me that to begin with?”

“Um, ma’am, I tried. You kept interrupting me.”

Seriously. What on EARTH, people????"

People have this annoying habit of putting items on the belt at my store that they really shouldn't. I've seen them put drinks, bags and even items they bought somewhere else on the belt and just leave it there. Usually cause I'm the snarky ankle biter I am, I make a joke asking them if they want to buy the item again, which usually gets them to realize their mistake and quickly pick up whatever they put on my belt.

Now, this is where that situation went horribly, confusingly wrong. I work in a metropolitan area and my store sees a ridiculous amount of traffic on any given day. Most of my customers are foreigners and as such can usually only speak broken English when they can speak it at all. So here I was ringing up this customer when I noticed she left her water bottle on the belt, no biggie, I reach and move to hand it to her when she explodes.

C(customer): NO! WHY THATS MY WATER!

Me: (still holding water bottle to her, utterly confused) I know? I'm handing it back-

C: WHY I HAVE TO PAY AGAIN? I ALREADY PAID!

Me: Miss, I'm literally trying to give you your bottle back- 

C: NO! I ALREADY PAID, YOU CANT MAKE ME PAY AGAIN.

Literally by this point my customary retail smile was gone from being yelled at by this lady, but thankfully a customer behind the woman just started laughing hysterically.

NC (New customer): Girl, shes just trying to give you back your water bottle, don't you have eyes?

Cue angry yelling customer turning red and meekly taking the water bottle while saying sorry a lot under her breath to me.

I just kept the thousand yard dead retail face pointed at her for the rest of the transaction while the customer behind her laughed and she died a little more of embarrassment with each passing moment."

I was helping my manager run produce yesterday, we're packed cause another store of our chain has closed for renovations, it's Sunday and our produce order is WAY too big. (it filled half the warehouse).

So I'm rushing like a chicken with no head, clearly very busy and a man comes up to me and asks if we 'have any green beans left'.

'I dont have any on my current pallet but I'll have a  run out back and check for you' I smile, he just sorta nods while fiddling with his phone.

I tell him to Wait There, he agrees and I rush out back, searching our GIANT prod order for beans.
 I even checked the chiller storage but with no luck.
I admit defeat and hurry back, it's taken me a few minutes to do this and I don't want to make him wait even longer for bad news.


I rush allll the way back to produce (at the stores entrance) and the man who asked is just fucking gone.

Poof, pow, bam no more man 


I'm more than a little peeved, i run my ass off for this guy and he just wanders off like an inattentive child.
I huffily mention it to my manager, he laughs and points at the shelf, we had oooodles of green beans the entire time.

'yeah I saw him aye, he waited for like 30 seconds before he walked out' my managee informed me, in kiwi.



I'll admit some blame, after 10 years in customer service, I should have known better than to trust a customers idea of looking for something.

Still mad he didnt wait till I got back though, make me waste my time without so much as a word of thanks."

I forgot that the shoes come in two different colours and that I can't see the different because of the type of colour blind I am. I grabbed the shoes and brought them out.

So I work at a grocery store that's notorious for poorly worded sale signs. It's pretty common that I have to over explain sale specifications to customers and typically apologize for how complex simple stuff is.

Specifically, I work in the bakery, and we had a sale for some of our breads; buy two and get them for $3.50 each. 

I get a call from a register up front telling me that a woman has a couple of our instore breads, and she says they're on sale but they're ringing up regular price. I tell her they are and sale and ask if she has two different kinds, which she says yes. I grab one of the kinds she has (the multigrain one, the other was buttercrust) and run up the the front of the store with the bread. We scan two of the multigrain and it shows up on sale. As a result we assume that the sale is only for two of the same kind.

The woman gets upset and says she didn't think running in for some bread would be so damn difficult. I agree and apologize, and the two of us call over our supervisor who rings her in for the deal on her two different breads, giving her the sale regardless.

I go back to my department and check the sign again. The woman comes up behind me and points to the sign, emphasizing that she's right and I'm wrong. I dunno why she came back since she got her way, but again I apologize, telling her that sometimes the signs are worded badly. She tells me I should fix that, but since it's a chain store we get the designs from head office outside the store, so I tell her I can't change it.

""Yeah, it seems problem solving skills are hard to come by at this store.""

She walks off, and I'm pissed. I now read the sign again, PROPERLY now that I don't have a Karen breathing down my neck, and read that the sale is only for our grain bread, so the buttercrust wasn't part of the deal.

I figured I'd chase after her and let her know, just in case she came back. I honestly did want to be nice about it and save her the trouble next time she came in. I call after her as she makes her way to the exit.

The bitch fucking ignores me. So, being the kind person I am, I just yell out (at the front where all the customers are paying) ""Ma'am the sale didn't work because the buttercrust wasn't listed, have a good night!""

She just walks out faster, I hope out of embarrassment.

I wish she was a one time offender, but everytime she comes by bakery there's always something for her to roll her eyes at. It's great."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/daq53a/i_hate_customer_service/,"I hate customer service I work at a hunting, fishing, camping, outdoors store, and sometimes, when I pull the short straw, I have to work at the customer service desk. I am not very well trained there, and often have to call for a supervisor, manager, or another employee to help me out. Today I had a customer who wanted to return some fishing reels that were broken. (Which, ugh in of itself. The quality of our merchandise has gone down SO far since we merged with another store. Causes lots of problems for customer service)

His reels, however exceeded our return policy. We have a generous 90 day return policy. Doesn't matter if you broke it in front of us. We take it back. But it has to be within 90 days. His was from nearly a year ago. 

I tell him I can't return it. He says he just wants to exchange it for a working one. It was the first time he used it. He bought it in November. You cant fish in the winter. I'm like, sounds fair. I don't know how to help you, though. So I call up a manager. Who tells him the same exact thing. But, he understands the struggle too, and is willing to take 50% off whatever he purchases to replace it. The guy blows up. Tells us we have horrible customer service. Any other place would have taken it back and exchanged it for him. Why are we being so horrible. He is gonna call corporate and complain about how awful we are. 

I just don't get it, guys. We can't just give you a $100 reel because you want it. Why do they think yelling at us is going to change our mind? I love working with this company, but man. I hate when they put me at the customer service desk."

So I work in a jewelry and watch store and on Friday a colleague from another store called me and told me this story:

A guy tells my collegue that he wants a couple of pieces of some jewelry and a watch and my collegue gets them for him. Atm if you buy 50€ worth of items, you get a 25€ discount coupon for your next purchase (till the end of October). In order to pay with the coupon and get a new coupon your total at the register has to be over 75€. So all of the items this guy was buying were over 75€, so he wanted to first pay one, get the coupon, then pay the other with the coupon and get a new one and then pay for the third one with the second coupon and get a third coupon. After talking with the manager my colleague started doing this, but as she peeped the watch to our computer, she realized that it was on sale. The price was lower than it would've been with the coupon, so she happily told it to the customer thinking that he'd be really happy to hear that. Nope. He ended up not buying anything, cause he would've had to pay less for all of it? Like why? Cause he didn't get that one coupon that he would've anyways used immediately? Sometimes you just can't understand customers...

Tl:dr Guy wants jewelry and a watch, leaves the store without buying any of it cause the watch was on sale"

So I'm ringing up this couple's flatbed of stuff, moving it from the belt back to the flatbed, and it's A LOT of stuff. While I'm doing this, I'm telling them about our rewards card to sell them. I did not stop what I was doing, I was literally booping things and moving them while talking. It took about 10 minutes due to the sheer volume of stuff they had. I did manage to sell the rewards, they're happy, I'm happy I got a sale. Then the next customer comes up. She has about three things. So I start, she smiles, then she starts. 

Lady: You are so slow.  (She's still smiling)

Me: Sorry about that. (Smiles back) 

Lady: If you had gone any slower you would've gone backwards. (All smiles!)

Me: (Laugh a little, cause what else can you do, kind of hoping she's not serious.)

Lady: No, really. 

Me: (Stares. Finished her three items. Give her price.  Stares some more. )

This staring thing actually goes on for about a minute, no lie. Usually I would say something with their total, but I'm a little annoyed. She finally puts her card into the machine, paying finishes. 

Me: Have a WONDERFUL night. Next time if you feel service would be too slow after our doors are locked, feel free to use our self checkout lanes.

Wiper blades are not hard. They are measured and displayed in inches. I tell you a measurement, you go pick a pair, you pay for them, you leave. That simple. The other issue I see is when I'm standing there helping a customer pick wiper blades. They will grab one and start to walk to the counter. I will grab the other side of the matching brand and when I get to the counter they look at me confused and ask ""oh did I grab the wrong one?""
""No, you need one of these and you need one of those.""
""You mean they don't come in pairs?"" 🤦‍♂️ I can count on one hand how many cars all use the same size wiper blade on both sides for which it would be logical for them to be sold in pairs.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/daf6tg/thats_no_trolley/,"That's no Trolley‽ Being my first post here I'll give you some background. I work as a duty manager in an Aussie bottle shop.

This happened earlier today during my shift. I had just finished helping clear out the queues of people at the registers, I had plans of finishing off running today's stock onto the shop floor, but this man had other plans in mind.

Without actually saying anything an older bloke gave me the tiniest of head nods to try and get my attention, which anyone except for the sharpest of eyes would have seen, lucky I have good eyes I guess? Anyways he asked for me to show him where ""overpriced famous wine"" was. Being a top shelf bottle I never looked down, and as I tried to walk around him to check the shelf I nearly knocked into the strangest thing I've seen working at this store for the past two years.

Rather than a shopping trolley or a basket, he was using [one of these](https://i.imgur.com/BSb7bGU.jpg). Not sure what else to call it other than a basket holder. This is where my customer service persona was nearly outed. When I laugh, I laugh a lot, and almost broke out of character. Luckily there was no stock on the shelf, so I ran out back with tears in my eyes.

I shouted to a co-worker out the back to save me and grab the bottle and give it to him whilst I spent the next 5 minutes trying to recover. When my co-worker came back she told me this wasn't the first time he had done this, last time another team member had stopped him trying to walk out to the car park with it. And later on I asked my co-workers on the register whether they saw it, and the one who served him said

""I told him it wasn't a trolley and he responded 'I know'"".

So today I guess I've met the most alpha shopper, and maybe the most ignorant man in Sydney, hopefully you enjoyed this! If you guys did I'll write some more antics I've been through, however I've been lucky for almost all of my customers to be very happy, except for the odd occasion. So lucky me I guess."

I manage a small furniture store in a formerly upscale area. The owner has been getting on to me for the last few weeks about randomly leaving a light on at night when I leave. 

He and I are the only people who have keys to the building as far as either of us know. Our landlord doesn't have a key.

I honestly don't think I have been doing it. I am very careful about turning everything off, especially once I've already been confronted by my boss about it. The last time this happened was Tuesday. I had the day off and one of my employees called saying the owner was complaining about the lights again. 

With him now complaining to other people, I have been extra careful about turning *everything* off at night. Double and triple checking before I leave with flashlight in hand. I'm not the one leaving lights on.

I needed to be in early this morning to meet a truck driver and I beat the owner in. As soon as I unlocked the door I noticed that the lights were on. 

Nothing has been stolen. The store cash is still exactly the same as it was last night when I left, the cokes in the refrigerator are still there. My custom shop Kramer guitar is still hanging on the wall where I leave it. (My job is really boring.)

The *ONLY* thing that was different other than my office light being left on was a half eaten pile of cat food left in front of our building where we don't normally feed the office cats. 

I have called every employee, our landlord, the maintenance man, and the owner's wife to make sure none of them borrowed a key and came in while we were closed. They all deny knowing anything about it. I trust them, but *somebody* is doing it.

Neither my boss or I really care. Whoever it is that's coming in at night to sleep on our mattresses isn't actually stealing anything other than my enjoyment of feeding the cats in the mornings. We just want them to turn out the lights when they leave.

Once she came back with her ID I opened her account to look at the notes. All they said was that she wanted to return some phones. Cool, you could have just said that. I asked her to explain the situation as there was obviously something else going on. She once again says just read the notes. I tell her they all it says is that she wants to return some phones.


Before I ever start a return I explain that there's a restocking fee per phone. I was going to also let her know that customer service had already credited her account for the restocking fees, which happens all the time. Before I can say that she puts her hand in my face and tells me ""you can be quiet now"".

Hands in my face just sets me off. I tried to hold it together but not before telling her she can not do that and just leave if she's going to ask that way. I turned around and walked off to let my manager know I was going to that back before I did something to lose my job.

Nothing too dramatic here, just a light-hearted funny story. I work in a large retail store and one day a customer (doesn't speak a lot of english) came looking to buy a kick scooter for her kid. I show her the children scooters and she spends some time checking them out. She starts off with the scooters with 3 wheels and decided that they weren't suitable for her kid's age, so she moves on to the bigger two-wheeled scooters. After a few minutes,

C: Hmmm, I don't like any of these they're not very stable

Me: What do you mean by stable? I can assure you our scooters are well designed

C: No, no, look at this 

She brings one of the scooters over and has one hand holding the handle. She then releases her grip and the scooter leans over and falls.

C: See! \*repeats this a few times\* It keeps falling down

At this point I'm kinda speechless and scratching my head, I mean ???? Does gravity not exist where she's from??

Me: Uhhhhh.... I mean, it has two wheels so it's gonna fall if you don't hold on to it (a little dumbfounded that I had to explain the laws of gravity to an adult)

C: No, no this won't do, thanks for your help

And then she left. I spent the entire day sharing the story with my colleagues, trying to figure out what exactly she was looking for and deduced that it may have been a scooter with an in-built side stand. Since she didn't speak much english, she probably had trouble communicating this. But either way, it made for a funny story and a good laugh, I still vividly remember watching her sigh as she dropped the scooter on the floor multiple times as if disappointed that gravity is a thing"

This may get ramble-y and I apologize for the length ahead of time. For background, I work at a specialty store in a pretty wealthy neighborhood of a major metro city in the US. Yesterday a woman yelled at me because I didn't know the exact polyphenal content of every olive oil in our store (she was looking for a number, which **does** exist, but even the professional tasters usually only say ""high"" or ""low""). Then this morning I had to lift a 160 lb. pallet up a flight of stairs by myself because the owners forgot a shipment was coming today. ANYWAY, that brings us to our first customer of the day:

A lady comes in from the rain and it's clear she's had some plastic surgery done. I know it's extremely problematic, but I really judge people for plastic surgery. I know, I know, but I'm currently uninsured (fuck the U.S.) and can barely afford to survive while she gets monthly botox. Whatever.

She asks for something by the wrong name and I - not correcting her, just confirming - use the right name. She goes over to inspect it and says ""um ya, that I guess."" As she walks away, she mumbles something I can't catch. This is how the exchange went, ""L"" for lady, ""M"" for me:

M: ""I'm sorry?""

L: ""What?""

M: ""Sorry, I just didn't hear what you said.""

L: ""The neighborhood discount.""

M: ""Oh! Yeah, I know the bakery offers one.""

L: ""No, I mean I would like the neighborhood discount here.""

M: ""Oh, I'm sorry, we don't offer a neighborhood discount here.""

This whole time she's been looking at her phone. She sets the phone down and looks directly at me.

L: ""Every store in this neighborhood offers a neighborhood discount.""

M: ""Okay, well, the only stores I know that offer the neighborhood discount are the cigar shop and the bakery, and that's only for-""

L: ""The what?""

M: ""The bakery?""

L: ""Which bakery?""

M: ""Uhh, \[inserts bakery name\] French bakery? It's two doors down from here"" (this is a very well known bakery that has a line out the door every Friday and Saturday morning. I go there once a week and routinely have conversations with customers and locals about it - if she doesn't know about it, it's highly unlikely that she lives or works in the neighborhood).

L: ""I don't know that one, but I do know the cigar shop and every other local business on this block offers a neighborhood discount.""

M: ""Well, I'm really sorry, but no one here has informed me that we offer a neighborhood discount.""

L: ""This is unbelievable. Totally unbelievable. You local businesses beg all of us to support you and promise discounts for locals, but when we do you don't honor them. I can't believe this.""

M: ""Ok, well, I'm really sorry. I could probably give you 5% off today?""

L: ""THAT'S THE NEIGHBORHOOD DISCOUNT!""

M: ""Right, that's the neighborhood discount at the bakery and the cigar shop. I don't know what other stores may offer.""

L: ""Unbelievable. Fine, yes, 5%.""

M: ""Ok, great."" I start to ring her up. I try to defuse the situation by just making some casual conversation. ""So what business do you own or work at?""

L: ""No, I live here.""

M: ""Oh, ok. Well, I know the bakery's discount is really only for other local business owners or employees. I don't think they offer it to people that just live in the neighborhood.""

L: ""This is totally ridiculous. I told you already I don't know what bakery you're talking about. I can leave my name and you can look it up later, I live here and I get the neighborhood discount.""

M: ""That's not necessary, I believe you \[I don't\], it's just the owners are extremely strict on giving out discounts they haven't told us about beforehand. I'm sorry for being difficult, but it's my job on the line here.""

L: ""You should know that locals get the neighborhood discount. It's totally unbelievable that you wouldn't honor it.""

She pays and starts to head out the door. I say, ""have a great day, try to stay dry out there."" She says, ""yep.""

First and foremost, I don't believe she lives here at all. I think she lives in a notoriously wealthy suburb nearby and probably heard about the neighborhood discount from the cigar shop owner and assumed every business offered it. Second, I basically gave her the discount to shut her up, but it only saved her 30 cents. I doubt the owners will even spot it, but we did just get grilled about giving out too many discounts a few weeks ago. I make minimum wage and my job is on the line because a wealthy snob wanted to save 30 cents."

Get to my register and BM is venting to the poor customer (PC) behind him, literally it was just two people in the store, about how rude I was and how fucking stupid I am, that he has shit to do. Dude, it 10:30 in the morning, what ""shit"" do you possibly have to do? The morning rush has passed. Now, I could've refused service to BM, but I didn't want to deal with the hassle. BM  slams a $20 on the counter and tells me to put $5 on pump ""blah"". You're in such a rush for *FIVE DOLLARS.* BM is still insulting me while I process his ""transaction"". I put the change on the counter, furthest from him as possible. Normally, I always tell people to have a great day, even those who are rude, but in the passive aggressive tone most retail workers know. BM didn't even deserve that, because he's still spewing insults (mainly calling me fucking stupid) and as BM is walking out he said I was wasting his time, so I just tell him *BYE*. 

Part of me wanted to ""accidentally"" hit stop on his pump, another regretted that I didn't get the number off his company truck to call and make a complaint. All in all, I'm over people who think they can treat retail/customer service people like garbage. In the time he spent complaining about me and insulting me, he could've been outside, pumped his gas, and gone, but no. BM had to insult me for 2 minutes straight. Thankfully PC was super nice to me afterwards. Working retail for nearly 4 years straight in the worst possible places, it's hard to get under my skin anymore."

To receive points you must book through our company. The number of people who don’t understand is astronomical (given how obvious it seems) but generally they’re okay that it isn’t valid for the points. Not everyone though. 

My personal favourite is a little old lady who called up. “I booked a $20,000 trip, how do I claim my points?”

After asking a multitude of questions it became apparent she hadn’t booked with us. I informed her that unfortunately we couldn’t give her any points, because it wasn’t our booking. 

The rant that followed was AMAZING. Swearing, ranting, “how was I supposed to know!!??” (I mean, why is that my problem?) and the final, best part - “well then, I’m going to get a pair of scissors and cut up my loyalty card RIGHT NOW.”

Already posted today, but here's another one from later on. 

Woman approaches me and gives me her rewards card to scan. Nothing odd, a lot of customers start off with that so they can see how many points they have to determine how much gas they want. 

Well, not this lady. 

I scan her card and she announces that she'd like to use her fuel points on pump 8. Still not odd at first, but she's just standing there waiting for what I assumed was for me to ask how much she wants the pump set for. I ask how much she'd like me to set it for and she tells me that she's already pumped. 

I inform her that the rewards card works by deducting money off your gas per gallon as you pump, thus it must be scanned at pump before you begin. The pump even asks you right off the bat if you'd like to use your rewards card, you have to hit yes or no to start the payment process which means this woman hit ""no"", proceeded to pay for her gas and then came to me to use her rewards. 

She could be a newer customer or maybe her husband does the gas buying, so I give her the benefit of the doubt and offer to call customer service (we're part of a grocery store) to see if they would manually remove her points and give her a cash refund for them. She responds to this by slapping the counter and demanding that I just give her the cash refund there, since I'm the one who messed it up. 

Still trying to be as customer servicey as possible, I asked what she meant and she informs me that I didn't ask her for her rewards card before she bought her gas, so I'm the one at fault. Once again, I explain that if you pay at the pump you have to follow the prompt on the screen and scan your rewards card before you put your credit card in to use it. Her response was to again demand that I compensate her with cash. 

Not entirely sure what to do about this anymore, I try to end it by explaining that I do not have access to her *store name* account so I have absolutely no way to change anything on it, including modifying her rewards points. But a manager in the grocery store does, and would be able to deduct the points and give her cash for them. 

She again drills me to just open my drawer and give her cash, I guess assuming that I have a magical button that I can push that tells me how much cash I owe her and stops my drawer from being that much short. 

She ended up cussing me out, leaving empty handed and not bothering to talk to customer service."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d9i38q/lady_you_think_youre_smart_which_is_not_the_same/,"Lady, you think you're smart. Which is not the same as actually being smart.... I sell glasses in a big box store. 

I had a 60 something lady come in that basically had the condescending ""I've never worked a day in my life so I'm above you"" attitude about her. You know the type. 

The arm had snapped off of her glasses, and she wanted to know if I could put her lenses in a new frame. This isn't an uncommon request in itself. They didnt come from our shop originally, so I explain that the lens has to be a very close match to the new frame and it can be hard to find that because suppliers like to use different patterns so you have to go back to the original shop. I'm still happy to see if I can find her one though. 

I go over and start seeing if theres one I can make work. This is like hunting a needle in a haystack, and there are usually only one or two frames at most that will work. Basically you have to take what you can get, and its rarely the ideal color or style.

Her original frame is a narrow rectangle. The lens size is 52 mm wide, and maybe 32 mm tall at most. Most optical frames have the width stamped on the inside, so she sees a 52 on the inside of hers. 

She pulls down this massive cat eye frame. Its in the 45mm tall range. Her lens is a skinny rectangle. This is a tall trapazoid. 

""This says 52 on the inside. Mine say 52 on the inside. They're the same size. I want these.""

I'm dumbfounded, but try to be as polite as I can. I reply ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but 52 is the width of the lens. While these two have the same width, they dont have the same height. Your lens is way too small for this frame. We'll have to go with a shorter one thats closer to a rectangle."" 

This was not acceptable.

She reiterates ""This says 52. Mine is 52. They ARE the same size. 52 and 52 are the SAME NUMBER."" 

""Ma'am, I understand that. But 52 is the width. These lenses are not even close to the same shape."" I even hold her lens up to the taller one to show her. ""I have no way to stretch your lens. Thats not something that can be done. We have to find one closer to the same height and shape."" 

""But they both say 52. What don't you understand about that?! 52 and 52 are the SAME! Its the same size! Why can't you seem to understand that!"" She says this like I'm a moron who probably can't even count to 52.

This lady seemed to think she'd found some archaic knowledge by matching these two numbers, like it was a shoe size. If it matches, it works. 

After about ten minutes of back and forth with two coworkers backing me up, she just refused to believe me and left in a huff. I like to imagine she struggled with fitting the square block through the circular hole as a child."

My homewares shop sold fabric, always by the metre or half metre. When we came to the end of the fabric roll and had something left over or had a piece with a fault in it, we sold these pieces as seconds at a heavily discounted price. They were immensely popular with people doing crafts or small DIY projects. These were usually kept in a big wire basket in the fabric section. 

Another thing to mention is that each fabric had their own name. If you were buying fabric, you told a staff member 'I'd like X metres of ABC fabric please'. Then it would be cut for you. But we couldn't put through a piece as seconds until the stock system had been reset to 0, which had to be done by a manager who checked the actual amount of fabric remaining and authorised it. 

This day I wasn't even meant to be on fabrics but someone was off sick and I was a spare pair of hands. I was sorting out fabric rolls when a lady came up to me. 

>L: hi, I've been looking through your basket. Have you got a 'Lucy' fabric [I can't remember its actual name] in there? 

>Me: unfortunately the seconds are just what's there. We don't have them anywhere else.

>L: are you sure? Haven't you got any more out back? 

>Me: no, sorry. They get bagged, priced and then put straight in there. 

>L: really? Are you sure you haven't got a piece somewhere? 

Cue 5min of this same conversation. This lady just couldn't work out that if it wasn't there then it wasn't there. I tried every way to explain. Then she asks: 

>Well can't you just cut a piece for me off then sell it as seconds? 

>Me: No, sorry. That would be a fraud offence and I could lose my job for that. 

Until this point shed been annoying but polite, but this answer set her off. She started shouting about how 'ridiculous' it was that we didn't have it. Meanwhile I was stood there wondering why she was finding this so hard to understand. 

Luckily for me the supervisor for that section came down for the start of her shift, saw what was happening and took over. From what the supervisor said she still didn't get the fabric she wanted."

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d95vmz/the_broken_lawn_mower/,"The ""Broken"" Lawn Mower Welcome back to Tales From Returns! Where I worked, we had options that they wanted us to use instead of normal returns. Such as Repair options. Example being, if someone bought a staple gun and it wouldn't run when we test it, we can give them a loaner and take the item in for repairs as long as it is within a certain time frame of the purchase. 

Most customers didn't like this option, for many reasons but the main one is that they couldn't get free items that way. This was super common and I think in the year and a half that I worked returns, only 1 person took me up on the repair option. The rest went with either, ""just give me my cash back"" or the ever classic, ""I want a new one of the same thing"". The first was easy to do, the second required a manager approval, even with a receipt, and they would try to talk them into doing the repair option, but that never worked.

Anyway, I had one customer though that knew of our repair policies and did he best to get around it and get a new mower each year. Since he would return the mower before the end of the applicable return policy, he would talk the managers into giving him a new mower for free each year, even before he got me the first time around. I still don't know how this a good business policy, if he is essentially stealing from us and never paying, but they told me to do it anyway. So I did.

But the following year, I was a little wiser to his and others schemes and had gotten good at talking customers either in circles or fixing the problem so they couldn't complain. \*note: most customers were decent and well meaning people, but there are the select few that try to rig the system\*

So the man walks in with his mower, or what I think is a mower as it is so bogged down with dead and dried up grass I can barely see the red paint underneath. He does his normal, ""I was mowing with it and it just stopped, I want a new one."" I offer him the repair option but he doesn't want to hear about it. So I go, ""Well, sir, I do have to inspect it first before I can return it, do you mind if I take it outside while I do that?"" He is confused but let's me do so.

I have repaired my old mower so many times at home now that I could pretty much be a mechanic for them somewhere, but this one was a different case. After cleaning it, I check the sparks, normal problem starter, they are good, practically pristine. I check power connections, they good. Motor, good and well oiled. Start up components, nice and well tuned. I can't figure it out. Until I pop the gas cap. Damn thing is bone dry. I rolled my eyes.

I come back in after roughly 10 minutes of checking and he goes ""can I just get a replacement mower for it now?""  But me being wise to him make an offer. ""Sir, I bet I can get it started in a minute. If I can, will you take it back?"" ""Uh, I mean, I guess, but what..?"" I don't let him finish as I pull a plastic gas carton out from behind my desk (one we use for filling up replacements) and put a little in the tank. Prime the motor and BAM! Its up and running like new again. 

""Here you go, sir! Its seems to be running just fine now. Can I help you with anything else today?"" He just stared at it dumbfounded for a couple of seconds before quietly wheeling it back out to his truck. To this day I wondered if he never thought I would try to refuel it first?"

I have been working as a clerk at a very popular retail grocery store for about 3 months now. Now, our store does sell dry ice in a big freezer box in the front of the store, and it has a lock on it.  Obviously, only employees know the code to unlock it. This is one of two crazy weird customer experiences I have had.  This happened a out a month ago, so the order of which the ice man said the things he's said is most likely out of order, but he did say these exact things. 

Characters:

Me

ID: Ice dude

C: Checker

S: Supervisor

So anyway, I'm slaving away at the checkout lane, bagging for a customer, when I hear my name called out.  I look to the left and a checker is looking at me and mentioning to an older looking man, with slightly shaggy clothes and Grey frizzy hair.

C: HeG67, he needs some dry ice, can you get it for him?

Me: yeah I got it.

So, I walk up to meet the guy, and we start walking down to the ice chest, and this is where the conversation starts. 

Me: So sir, how much dry ice do you want?

ID: Oh don't worry about it, I can get it myself.

Me: Oh, I'm sorry sir, but I just need to know how much ice you need.  Also, the ice chest is locked.

ID: Oh don't worry, I've been doing this for 5 years every week.  You can go back to bagging.

Red flag #1: Not only are only the employees allowed to even touch the Dry Ice, but there is no way that this man has been doing this every week for 5 years before someone caught him. 

Me: Sorry sir, but I need to grab the ice for you.  Company policy.

ID: Well, I've done this in the past, look, I even brought a glove to help!

He pulls out a glove that was meant for grabbing the Dry Ice from his back pocket.

Me: I'll just get it for you, sir.

By this point, we had made it to the ice chest and I reached for the lock. 

ID (starting to sound flustered): Look, I don't need help, I got this, I k ow the code anyways.

Red Flag #2: What? No employee is allowed to give out the code for ANY lock in the store.  Whether he knew the code or was just bluffing, that freaked me out.

Me (ignoring his insistence and going to unlock the lock): how much dry ice do you want, sir?

ID: Idk, let me look to see how much you have.

Red Flag #3: OK man, how have you been doing this for 5 years and not know how much ice you get?  Now my spidey senses are going wild.

Me: Sir, I can't open the chest without knowing owing how much ice you want.

ID (clearly frustrated that I am following the rules): Again, I don't know how much I want, open it up so I can see what you have.

This goes back and forth for a minute or two, all the while I'm starting to freak out, because this is my first job, first interaction with this kind of customer.  Then, my savior, my Supervisor comes up.

S: What are you doing, HeG67?  Sir, can I help you? 

Me: I-

ID: I'm trying to get some dry ice, but this kid won't open the lock for me!

S: Okay sir (she motions for me to back off, so I re-lock the chest and slowly back up) how much ice do you want? 

He reiterates that he doesn't know, yadda yadda. He then just tells S that he'll get it. 

S: Sir, you're not allowed to get the ice on your own. 

ID: You know what?  Fine.  I'm not getting any ice, this is BS.  I've been doing this for five years, I'm never coming back here again! 

S: OK, bye now! 

ID barges out of the store yelling obscenities at us all the way until the door closes.  S and I make eye contact, with me wide eyed and unable to comprehend what just happened. 

S: It's OK HeG67, just go back to bagging.

Me: Yup!
Hope this doesn't break any rules."

I was checking sales at the till, while one of my cashiers was open beside me.

A man comes through her line with an exchange from a month ago. She tells him she cannot take it, as our limit is 7 days. The man got upset at her but she wasn't about to budge, bless her stubbornness for rude asses (I backed her up, as her equally stubborn supervisor). He leaves pissed off that his tantrum wasn't rewarded, and a woman and her friend come through next.

This woman says, ""whenever someone does that to you, tell them you're not here to do your job quickly, but to do your job right"".

My cashier agrees that this is how she works, and shes not working minimum wage to be shoved around. The woman then launches into a story...

Her husband was a passenger, and during the flight, the engine had a massive failure and he crash landed into a lake. He and the pilot drowned, and were found 8 days later. The oil in the plane was found to be long due for a change, and nobody had been checking the plane whatsoever.

A completely avoidable accident took her husband's life, and she was devastated.

She was told there was a double rainbow over the lake the day her husband was found; one for the pilot, and one for her love. Well, one year later, she was mourning the loss as she visited his grave, and... what else does she see across the sky, but a double rainbow! Her husband was watching over her!

She said the double rainbow changed her whole life. She told us, ""Every time it rains on me, someone wishes me a long life. Every time I find a coin on the ground, someone wishes me good fortune. And every time I see a double rainbow... I remember to love those around me.""

Again, no idea if she just made this up to be motivational, but I'll be damned if she didn't speak with her heart, and I will be DAMNED if she didn't make my cashier, myself, and her friend beside her all tear up a little."

I was a Cashier and we had some simple rules that were even pasted on the registers for everyone to see. One of these rules was that there were to be no open bags in the store, such as backpacks, grocery store or mini mart bags, or garbage bags. We do allow them to keep the bags at the front of the store, but don't take responsibility if anything is stolen. So one day, about a good three or four days after I finished my training to run the front.

Me: Sir, we can't allow open bags in the store. If you like you can leave them behind the register and I can try to keep an eye on them for you.

GD puts only one of his two bags down that was more full and tries to take an empty one.

Me: Sir, you have to leave both bags before I can let you move around the store.

GD: Oh this bag is mostly empty, I don't have anything in it.

Me: I see that Sir, but that does mean I have to make sure you leave the bags up here.

GD: But there is  hardly anything in it! I shouldn't have to leave it!

Me: Sir, the fact that you're telling me it's empty only gives me more reason to ask you leave it here. People steal from this store because we don't have detectors, it's for the safety of the store.

GD is now clearly upset and starts to raise his voice loud enough for the people in the back to here

GD: You motherfucker! You just don't want me taking my belongings around the store!

At this point I'm feeling a little overwhelmed but kept my cool

Me: I understand you're upset Sir, but you just have to leave you bags up here.

GD: Fuck you! You motherfucker! I'm never going to shop here again!

My manager came up to see what was going on as GD was grabbing his stuff

Me: I understand you're upset Sir, and I think it's fine that you decide not to shop here. Have a nice day.

GD left, I told my manager what happened and she said he's not gonna be allowed in the store anymore, then covered for me so I could get my break in."

This was on a particularly busy day, I had 4 customers in line, and the person who was my back up was busy helping a customer with a printer. I have two customers left in line when the mail guy comes, I'm about to go to sign off for a couple packages he leaves but he stops me and says ""these don't need signing, I can tell you're busy"" and walks out.

A few minutes later a middle aged couple walks into the store, looks down at the packages left by the mail man and kicks them... twice.... 

Me: oh, hi can I help you find something? 

Lady: yes, we want boxes like these. For mailing smaller things

Me: of course! Those are in aisle 15!

Lady: oh! You have them for customers? Like just to take? 

Me: ... we sell them if that's what you mean, you take them when you pay for them. 

Husband: oh,  well what about boxes you get things delivered in? Do you not give them to customers when you empty them out? Could you maybe empty these out and we can have the boxes? Or the boxes that you get stock delivered in.

Me: sorry, unfortunately it has to be my manager to open the mail, and he's busy right now. And we don't get stock delivered in cardboard boxes, we get them in plastic bins that we send back and reuse. When we do get cardboard boxes, we put them right in the baler so they dont take up space in our receiving area.

Husband: that's ridiculous,  can I go back there and take a look at the baler? In case they haven't crushed them today

Me: ... you want to go in our receiving area? 

Husband: yes, I want to see if you have boxes back there! 

Me: I'm sorry sir, I cant let you back there for multiple legal reasons, but as I mentioned, we have boxes that size for about two dollars in aisle 15. 

Husband: okay fine, we'll go take a look. 
They walk away muttering about how little help I am and how ""it's a frickin box, why cant they just give it away, why do we have to pay for a box.""

About five minutes later the husband come back up front on his own, when he thinks I'm not looking he goes around the register that's furthest from mine and starts looking at a box that we use to hold recyclable ink cartridges. 

Me: sir, I can not have you looking around back here and especially not touching ink cartridges that could explode on you. 

As I'm saying this this, I look to the back of the store and see that the wife is sticking her head through the doors that lead to the receiving area. It was like telling kids to not do something only to have them go and try to do that exact thing. So at this point I grab my mic and talk loudly into it, enough for the husband and customers in line to hear it: 

*I have two customers going into employees only areas, after I already asked them not to. One is up front behind the register and another is in the back, near receiving* 

The husband turned bright red and shuffled out from behind the register to collect his wife from the back of the store. They both stormed out of the store, but not before trying to grab boxes that we have at the entrance for customers that come in to recycle old printers and other such things. They gave up when they realized the boxes are glued to eachother, and walked out of the store like scorned puppies."

Me: Alright one second while I pull that screen up. (pulled screen up and prepared to enter info) Alright Ma'am, what's your name for this measurement?  
CL: Customer Name  
Me: Okay and phone number that the team can reach you at?  
CL: Customer Number  
Me: Awesome, now I just need the address for the measurement, and then that will give me the dates and times available to schedule it.  
CL: What that's ridiculous, why can't you just give me the time window now?  
Me: Well, I need to know where the team is going so that I can schedule it and they have a place to go?  
CL: This is completely stupid. You don't need my address for \*\*\*\*. Why would you need that for this, it's a simple thing you moron. I swear to christ that they find the dumbest ass \*\*\*\*es to work here. Where's your manager I want to speak to them.

This just happened tonight, I'm still laughing about it, so I thought Reddit might want to laugh about it too. (Forgive formatting or punctuation ect, I'm on mobile.)

M: Me 

T: Tag-swapping idiot. 

I work in a store that has a HORRIBLE problem for stealing as it is a thrift store on a rather bad end of town. ANYWAYS;

I'm currently taking a course to become a security guard, so being able to stop shoplifting is really fulfilling for me. So, of course I see this guy with a HUGE hood (couldn't even see his face) and a backpack. Usually a backpack in this store is enough to keep an eye out. 

I'm working fitting rooms, and we have a company wide policy that you need to count the customers items before they go in, and you can only take 6 items in. Anyways, this guy tells me he has 6, I tell him I need to physically count them (people put shirts inside shirts all the time so feeling the clothing is important.) He is already irritated at this, but complies, jokes on me, he has 8, so that's yet another red flag. A looonngggg time passes, way too much for 6 items, and he basically throws about half the items at me, and rushes to the register. As I start putting the clothing on the rack, I see a low end brand item tagged with a high price, a usual sign it has been ""tag-swapped"" (happens super often, people putting a $2 tag on something Nike for example so they don't have to pay $10). Also, our tags are designed so they can't be ripped off without destroying the tag, so you can tell it has been swapped pretty easily. Of course, all the items he gave me have ripped up tags that are not the price they should be. I get excited, show my manager, and she knows it makes me happy to call people out for this so she lets me handle it. 
Poor girl at the register is brand new and has already finished scanning his items, so I ask to her stop for a second and plop the entire pile of clothes he threw at me in front of him. 

M: ""None of these tags are correct unfortunately, so I'm going to have to re-tag them so they are the correct price."" 

T:""How do you know?""

M:""I'm actually not supposed to tell you how I can tell, but our company reserves the right to correct tags that are not correct at any time.""

T:""Well that's something your company should work on, because I didn't do anything with the tags."" 

M:""Oh, should we? Hey (manager), it seems we need to work on tagging items correctly. Either way, I need to re-tag all of these items."" Infuriatingly, we are not allowed to accuse anyone of anything, so I can only re-tag the items and hopefully he will learn his lesson. 

T:""Well then, I only want these jeans, how much will they be?"" He is being super rude at this point. 
I look at all the tags I grabbed off the other clothes he swapped with, only one says jeans, roughly $16. 

M:""Seems this was the original tag, as I can see this hoodie shouldn't have a jeans tag."" 

T:""fine, but just so you know, I'll be calling head office."" 

I proudly display my name tag to him so he can see my name, and inform the manager, to which she accidentally laughs out loud, as she knows everything is happening. It was an honest accident, don't hate on my manager lol, she's awesome. 
He left with just one item, and left me with at least 8 items, all with wrong tags, only to anticipate an amazing call/meeting with head office about stoping a shoplifter. I know he won't call, but part of me really really wants him to. I did everything right, didn't accuse him, just reserved my right as an employee, and stopped a ahop-lifter. Try me, buddy.

Edit: Line breaks. I got rightly ripped apart for my formatting, honestly some of your comments about it were kind of clever. Thanks for letting me know how to fix it, I'm partially new to Reddit and have never posted a story from mobile. Hope the new readers can enjoy my story now!"

Hello ladies and men and nonbinary friends. Here's another tale from everybody's favorite place where nothing's over a dollar that happened yesterday afternoon.

Cast: me, Aggressive Lady (AL) with a minor appearance form my manager

I was stocking candy when a customer came up and asked if we had iphones. Given where I work I assumed she meant the chargers and said no. 

AL: I meant the iphone chargers.

me: I guessed as much. No we don't.

AL: Alright. Why'd you disrespect my mom?

My brain basically shut down for a few seconds because what the fuck? and where the fuck did that come from?

me: Um, what?

AL: *aggressively jabbing her finger in my direction* My mom told me that *you* banned her and I want to know why!

me: Um... I don't have the power to ban people from the store, so...

AL: Then why was she banned?!

me: I don't even know who your mom is, so I can't tell you.

AL: *pounding her fist against her palm* I just want to know who disrespected my mom because I'm about to disrespect them!

me: Like I said, I don't even know who your mom is, so I can't tell who banned her or why she was banned in the first place.

AL: That's fine. I live in the area so I'll be back.

She left after she said that and I immediately went to go relay this story to my manager.
 
Then, while pounding her fist against her palm, she was like, ""I just want to know who disrespected my mom, because I'm about to disrespect them!"" I told her that I didn't even know who her mom was and she said that was fine because she lived in the area and she'd be back before walking out.

I went to manager to tell her all this and she said that we only have three women banned from the store (the majority of our ban list is kids/teenagers who steal candy) and we're pretty sure none of them are her mom. Plus there's only one woman I've personally had problems with and she's almost definitely related to the girl in question so like....... bruh.

I have a felling that girl's probably gonna get banned from the store too once my manager sees her in person, because she's a good manager who doesn't take any shit and won't let *us* be disrespected.

Y'all. I'm so tired. So, so tired."

A guy came up to the registers with three small housewares items, totaling $1.75.

The guy rummages in his pockets, and clatters down $1.50 in quarters, two dimes.... and FOUR pennies.

>Man: ""Well, looks like I've only got $1.74. You can take that, right?"" He gives me a tiny smirk, automatically assuming that I could.  
>  
>Me, apologetically, ""No sir, I'm sorry, but I can't.""

His smirk dies.

>Man: ""Well, do you have one of those coin trays?""

(Aka the give a penny, take a penny thing.)

>Me: ""No, sir. We don't have one of those.""   
>  
>Man: ""Why not?!""

I explain. To sum it up, our money goes to a local No-Kill animal shelter for surrendered pets and strays. We make money off items sold, and we have little house shaped banks to take dollar bills, and a pair of Big Belly Banks -- one penguin, one begging dog -- for coins, which kids and even adults love. Any declined change goes straight into these banks as a direct donation.

>Man: ""That's ridiculous. You should just have a tray for loose change!""

He then drops a dime on the counter.

Now... here's the thing... he didn't rummage in his pocket to try to scrounge up what he owed. He made no effort to LOOK for more money. He literally had the dime in his palm the ENTIRE TIME he was trying to get me to accept a penny less for what he was buying.

I don't say the half dozen smart mouthed things that flew through my head as I made the nickel in change for him.

>He retorts, in what is clearly a Direct Order From His High And Mighty-ness, ""Just keep the nickel and use it to spot someone else who is short! I can't believe you won't take a freaking penny less!""  
>  
>Me, poo-eating grin, calling out as he stomps out the door, ""The homeless animals thank you for your donation, sir! I'm sure they appreciate you not STEALING MONEY from them!""

Maybe petty. Maybe passive aggressive. But I don't regret a word of it. 

**Epilogue:** I fed the penguin bank his nickel at the end of the night. Oddly enough, no one else had the gall to try to short change our charity."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d8j8ma/maybe_you_should_just_show_up_at_the_time_the/,"Maybe you should just show up at the time the order is supposed to be ready! Right, so this is my first post here, sorry if the formatting isn't up to par.

&#x200B;

So I have this story I wanted to share. It's nothing too dramatic or outlandish, but it's those kinds of things that make you cynical about people when you think about the fact that they act like the world revolves around them.

So I work at a grocery store that I'm not at liberty to identify. I work in the deli section of the store, which is usually the busiest part. While most of our customers are okay, with some that actually treat us like human beings and not robots, there are some that are less than friendly. I'm sure everyone knows what I'm talking about.

It was noon on Sunday, and of course, that means that everyone and their mother is raiding the deli like flies to a pile of brown bodily waste. Lines as far as the eye can see on the slicers, sub shop, and the hot case. Not only that, but we also have a ton of online orders that we need to push out on time. Customers choose the time they want the order to be ready, but it always has to be thirty minutes in advance of the time it was ordered and printed out on our end. While they are are a huge pain sometimes, I like to remind myself that if we didn't have that, they would all be customers added onto the lines, so it would be completely unmanageable.

I was personally completing the sub orders we had at the time, churning them out at a reasonable pace. I wasn't getting too swamped, thankfully. I get one order that's due at 2:00, and since I finished all the other orders I had at the time, I get started at around 1:40. Normally I could get it out around 1:50, but there were two subs I had to complete, and we were already running low on the sub kits they requested. I only had one whole sub kit, so I needed another one. It was the store brand, so normally we have them presliced from a special section in the distribution warehouse, but unfortunately, we were completely out of them, so I had to slice it manually. It's also three different types of meat combined, so it takes even longer than a normal sub kit. It takes me about three minutes to take the meats out, slice them, weigh the kit so that I'm not using too much, and then wrap them all up. Then I get asked to help out a few customers since we're absolutely packed. I could have just said I'm doing an online order, but I figured I have enough time to get the subs done since they were both the same and they weren't too complicated. Plus I don't like to leave my coworkers in a lurch. I help around three customers for about nine minutes, putting the time to around 1:52. I can still do the subs in eight minutes.

Once I finished with the last customer I helped, I went right back to the subs. Once I got the meats and condiments on the bread, I found that I needed eight slices of provolone cheese for the subs. I go over to the sub shop, but find that the provolone I had sliced like fifteen minutes back was all gone. *Wonderful.* I go ahead and take out the provolone from the case again, and I end up waiting two minutes before I can even slice enough provolone for me and the sub shop, since everyone else is using the cheese slicers we have. I get a large stack of provolone sliced up, take what I need, drop the rest off at the sub shop, and then go back to making the subs. Little did I know, the customer that ordered the subs showed up around 1:54. She just waited there and didn't bother to tell anyone until about two minutes before 2:00. When she did, she complained to one of the other associates there at the time that she needed the subs as soon as she got there, but the time on the ticket said 2:00 *sharp*, no later. That associate went ahead and told me that she was complaining about the subs.

Now look, if someone shows up early, and they're cool about it, I'll work with them and try to get it out as fast as I can. I really don't mind doing that because we're supposed to provide excellent service. She, on the other hand, was raising a stink about how I didn't get it out fast enough, yet she was the one that was early by six whole minutes. Any other normal person would have simply waited there until we got the subs out on time, but apparently she's so important that we needed to get it out on her own schedule, even though she chose the time when she ordered the sub. If she simply just showed up at the time she set, the subs would be ready. So now that she's complaining, I need to hurry and complete the subs at her convenience when we're still packed. Of course, I didn't do that as a favor, I did it because I just want to get her out as fast as I can. I get them done at 1:59 on the dot. The associate that heard the complaint also went ahead and changed the prices on the subs, taking a dollar off for the ""inconvenience"", which I really didn't like because it just rewards bad behavior, but that's beside the point. I get the subs wrapped up and packaged, and when I go to hand it off to the customer, she's gone like a fart in the wind. I'm left standing there for a minute with two subs in my hand, looking like an idiot while I try to find the customer. Like wow, if you're in such a hurry to get the subs, why the *hecc* would you just leave in order to do something else? Not only that, we're not exactly empty considering *everyone* wants sliced meats, subs, etc. Anyone else would have understood that we're in the fecal matter.

So now I figured she probably went to customer service to complain, so I go ahead and walk over to the little refrigerator we have to place the subs in there until she comes back. Lo and behold, she does. The associate that talked to her lets me know that she did, so I go ahead and hand the subs over to him because I don't even want to look at her face. He gets that I'm pretty annoyed by the customer, so he goes ahead and hands the subs off to her. Of course, she just takes the subs and then just walks away. Oddly enough, she didn't exactly look like she was in a rush. We then talked about how that customer was full of it for a minute, and then went back to the grind.

&#x200B;

So yeah, there you go. Sorry if it was too wordy, but I tend to include quite a few details when I write. As I said, it wasn't really crazy or anything, but it's those kinds of things that make the job a hassle. Sorry about no dialogue either, I didn't listen in to the conversation because the whole place was nothing but a sea of people chattering. It probably wasn't anything important."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d8gpy9/i_only_have_penniessorry/,"“I only have pennies...sorry” I’ve worked for a decently sized farm store chain for about 3 years now. This happened back when I was about a month in. 

(For reference, my store is small. It only has two registers and, therefore, two tills. I don’t get my own till and I can hop to either when ever I need/want to.)

I was opening with one other manager who was busy stocking feed shelves while I was put on register. About an hour after we opened, an older customer walks in and I can hear the immense amount of coins jingling in her purse. The woman couldn’t have been younger than 60 so I just assumed she was one of those people that liked to carry coins on them. She didn’t seem like she was struggling to carry her purse so I thought nothing of it and welcomed her in.

The lady walks around the store for about 10 minutes (the entire time she’s the only one in the building other than me and my manager) and eventually brings up a couple bones for her dog. I scan them and give her her total: around $10 with tax. 

Hearing this she heaves her purse onto the counter and it lands with a hefty thud. I’m startled, she’s unfazed and tips it over to pull out a gallon sized zip-lock bag full of pennies. 

“This is all I have...is that okay?” 

Internally I’m screaming “Wtf?! NO! There are multiple banks a mile down the road. Why didn’t you trade these in for bills?” Instead I sheepishly told her it was okay and had to count them by hand. She tried to help but I told her to just not and let me take care of it since I didn’t want her to miscount (I didn’t think she would but I didn’t want to get in trouble if she did). 

Counting out the total took about 10 minutes and left her bag almost completely empty. She took her bones and receipt and left with a smile. I was still screaming at her mentally. 

Her pennies filled up both the penny trays and extra coin trays in both tills, and we still had to put some in the store’s safe cause we had no where else to put them. I got multiple comments about the amount of coins in each till by customers who noticed. 

In the three years I’ve been here since then I haven’t seen her again. I’m not exactly sad about that either."

Customer: “I’d like to make a couple returns.”

Me: “Okay sure.”

She takes the dollar store bag and dumps the small “bottles” (??) on the counter. I ask if she has a receipt and she pulls out a receipt for my store but it’s over a month old. I scan the barcode on the receipt and scan the bottle.

“NOT ON FILE” appears on the screen.

Today, I got to sit back and watch while they interacted.

The lady comes in, already looking somewhat cross, carrying an old Dell Inspiron from around 2012 or so, and starts demanding to see our batteries. I told her that I don't believe we carry those in store, but I'd be happy to help her order one online. She immediately started yelling at me, telling me that we did have it, and demanding to see a manager. He was standing right behind me, talking with the tech support team for a client's computer repair. He puts them on hold and tells her the same thing I just said, and asks where she saw we had it.

Apparently, an employee at another electronics retailer told her we had one. Not another location of the same chain, but a completely different store. My manager tried to explain that we don't carry any sort of laptop batteries in store, much less for such an old model, when she starts going off on him for being rude and ""chit chatting on the phone"". She takes his picture and says she's going to call corporate for his rude behavior, and asks to see the manager again, I guess not believing he was the manager. Then she demands his name and employee ID. He gives her his name, but refuses to give her his employee ID (which we use to access all sorts of private information), so she goes off on him again about how we are giving poor customer service and it's public information, before storming out of the store, yelling how she's going to get him fired.

Most of us will bend it to about $7 but no more.  There's a 2 fold reason for this.  

1) we only count loose change once a week and more than $5 extra in loose change throws the daily till count way off.

2) the weight of too much loose change will literally break our tills.  A coworker took pity on a customer last week and took $19 in loose change and about an hour after, her drawer wouldn't shut and we found the weight had broke the tracks.

Lady comes up, doesn't look like a typical Karen.  She's wearing a tshirt from a local event and usually this group is extremely friendly.  She unloads her cart, makes small talk...

Me: okay so that rounds up to an even $75. 

And she pulls a jar out of her rather large purse.  It's filled with loose change.  She started to dump it out...

Lady: No.  You have to take this.  It's the law.

Me: No, ma'am, actually a business can decide what forms of currency they will take. Some places will not take bills larger than $20. We cannot take more than $5 in change.  If you want to roll it or use the Coin Star, we will accept it then.

Lady: NO!  I'm not paying that machine 12% of this!

Me: I'm sorry but that is policy.

Lady: Manager. Now.

Me: *points to name tag* That would be me at this time.  

Lady: That doesn't say manager.  That says *lead*. My horses have leads so what does that make you?

Me: Our store doesn't use the term manager.  We are leads, as in leading our departments and fellow employees in good customer service.  

Lady: *snorts* Whatever.  You're just as cashier trying to be something you're not.   Give me your '*leader*' then.

Fine.  Pages for store manager...excuse me...store leader...to come to my register.

Lady started yelling immediately about how I'm refusing her service and she isn't having it.  We have to take her money or she will call corporate and the IRS(????) for us refusing to take her money, it doesn't matter what form it is in.  

Boss: Well, this is my store, my employee, my policy.  You can take it home and roll it, you can take it to the machine then use the voucher or take it to your bank.  That's your options.  My tills will not hold extra loose change.

Lady: I can't believe your willing to lose a customer over this.  Screw it. I'm out of here.

With that she walked away.  Figure she won't be back.  

20 minutes later, bagger comes back from doing her take back and we hear the Coin Star.

We looked at each other...you don't think...naw...couldn't be...

It was.  

40 minutes after we heard the Coin Star starting, we hear it winding down.

Over an hour after her leaving, she is back in my line.   

Lady: Fine.  I went to your damn machine.  It cost me over $200.  Where's my stuff?  

Me: Unfortunately, another of our policies is to only hold groceries for 20 minutes.  It's been over an hour.  It's been taken back.  

Lady:  WHAT???

Me: let me call someone. 

Quickly inform boss.

Boss to lady: if you will give me your list, you can wait in my office while I collect your items.

Lady:  NO.  I JUST WANT MY DAMN MONEY NOW AND THE FEE YOU SCREWED ME OUT OF

ETA: I re-read this and realized I didn't type what I thought I had.  I did type *in her purse* but what it was supposed to say was *in her purse and I'm hoping/assuming in her car*. That will teach me to attempt to write a post, get a child ready for school and feed/water/potty my pack of dogs.

Me: thanks mate, ill bring it out, but can i get you to wait outside. Cant have you in here.

I go and grab some CWs to help as the order was at least 25 items long and i wanted it to get out asap.
I get some items and go to the truck that C had driven, to load him up and i fimd he still wandering around and looking at the stock (which are just boxes with codes on them)

Me: mate i really need you to wait outside. Please step outside.

Me: well you cant wait in here. Im sorry but youll have to wait outside or in your car.

I loaded his truck and go back to get some more items for his order and inform the boss that we may have some trouble with the customer but ill handle it.

I go back out with the last of his items as CWs have been loading the rest while i spoke to the boss and i find C still im the warehouse but this time he was all the way on the otherside trying to hide when i walked past.

Me: mate you need to leave now. Im not going to ask again

C: its cold outside. Just trying to get warm. No need to be rude.

Me: then why are you all the way over here? No way its just to get warm, please follow me to the door and ill load you up so you can go.

C: okay lets go.

We get over to his truck and i put the last items in and tell him i just need to get a pen for him to sign the dotted line (to comfirm his received his furniture)

Im gone for all of 2 minutes and i find C inside again, this time even further from the door.
I grab some CWs and tell them to go to door and wait for me.

Me: look mate, you need to leave. I asked you multiple times to wait outside. Now get out.

C: dont be rude im a customer. Im allowed to look at this stuff as ive brought them and i wanted to make sure they are stored correctly.

Me: okay, you wanna be like this. Fine we'll do it your way. 1 Your not a customer at (name) your a customer of (name) we operate as an independent business (same name, same business, same owners but its for tax reasons of something im not payed enough to understand)
2 your not allowed to step foot in the warehouse for any reason.
3 now get the hell out now.

C:your so rude im going to file a complaint.

Me: do what you want as long as you leave.

He finally starts walking to the exit, we get to the door and i tell CWs to unload everything off the truck.

C: WAIT! What are you doing!?! Its my stuff. You cant take it.

Me: you can pay for delivery. Itll be $320 and itll arranged for 2 days time. Now leave. I will not ask again.

C: but its my st...

Me: LEAVE!

He finally gets it and leaves. Just tk double check we get everything i did a count and noticed that we pulled off two extra items that werent on his list.
He called my boss and complained.

B: hey 'Halt' can i see you for a minute

Me: sure.

B: i just had a customer call and complained that you were rude and refused to give him his items or even look for them and now your making him pay for delivery.

Me: no. I loaded his truck up but i found him in the warehouse multiple times and asked him to wait outside, he refused to listen and so i told him to he can get his order delivered and unloaded his truck.

B:i figured he was twisting the story. I just have to ask or else the big bosses will get all pissy. 
did you count what came off?

Me: yeah and we pulled two extra items off that we didnt load.

B: were they his?

Me: no not on the list and the truck was empty when He arrived.

B: i would cancel his order but its to big of an order. Ill just pass it on the head office.


Anticlimactic ending but boy do customers that dont follow simple rules annoy me so much.

Ill update if any thing more comes off it.

TLDR: customer refused to wait outside so i made him pay to get his items for delivered. He complained as i unloaded the items from his truck only to find he had stolen a few items.
Calls to complain and boss sides with me."

A bit background: I work in a small store and have been doing so for about 2 weeks, so I'm fairly new to the system at the register as I also just got introduced to it last week. I wear a pin saying I'm new but I really do try my best to not make mistakes.

So today I'm suiting at the register and doing my thing and everything is going great, besides some barcodes that aren't working (sigh). Out from the back of the line a lady starts calling me, demanding I go help her find something. I obviously can't since there's a line. Call someone over and I think that's done with. 

Once she's at the register and getting her things checked out she also seems fine. I finish up she pays and I ask if she wants the receipt . I don't know if she didn't hear me or didn't register but she says no. I wish her a good day and start checking out the next in line. 

This is when the woman gets mad. She wants her receipt. I say sorry but I thought you said no when I asked. She freaks and says I never asked and demands the receipt. As I'm in the middle of checking someone out then I can't give her her receipt unless I finish up the next customer or call my boss to cancel the entire checkout for the next customer. The woman in checking out have only a few items left so I apologize and tell the angry one that she'll have to wait 30 sec and then I'll be able to access her receipt. She flips even more now yelling how unfair that is. I finish the checkout and find the receipt in the system and she hufs and pufs and goes over to another register to pack up her groceries. The woman that was behind her reassures me that she also heard the woman say no.

Angry woman then goes one of my coworkers and rants about me loud enough so that I can hear and wants me disciplined or fired for my unprofessional way of handling the receipt. Then she goes silent and storms out of the store. 

I didn't hear anything bad from my coworker but it really put a damper on my mood to the point where I was almost crying.

Edit: spelling"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d827p6/im_on_a_budget/,"'I'm on a Budget!' So this happened a few hours ago and although it's note quite the thrilling tale I wanted to share for my first post here, it'll certainly do.


I work in a chain supermarket, no deli or anything like that but it's pretty big and quite cheap. I'm on tills for the start of shift, all is normal till a woman comes up with about $50 in groceries.

Although she dumped them all on my tread the moment she arrived, she waited until it was her turn to suddenly sort through them and put 'priority' items first. I just had to sit and wait while she held everyone up.

I smile, ask her 'Is there an amount you need to stay below? I can keep an eye on the total for you' .

She shoved a plastic bag in my face to scan and kinda yelled 'I Sorted It! Just Scan THESE First!' while pointy at the front of her pile.

I'm scanning and all seems to be going well untill she suddenly snaps and tells me to stop half way through.

'That's enough! I have a budget I need to stick to!'. I smile and say 'no worries' while looking at the pile of stuff I'd now have to return.

She bags, pays on card and I think we're done when she then suddenly pulls out a mountain of spare change. I quickley cup my hands to take and count it for her but she ignores this and instead slaps it down on the counter, sending change all over.

'How much is that!?' she snapped, pointing at the pre packaged apples she brought up.

'$2' - me

'and 'ow much is dat!?' she pointed a prepackaged bad of mandarins.

'2.49'

'How much are they TOGETHER!?' she rolled her eyes, as if I was the one being inconvenient.

'... 2 plus 2.49 is $4.49'


She starts pushing change around despite a $2 coin sitting right in front of her.

'Would you like me to count up this change? We can work out how much there is then an-' I begind but she again cuts me off and says 'JUST DO WHAT I TELL YOU!' right in my face.

I just lean back and let her waste her time while everyone glares at her, she ended up paying 3 more things out of her spare pile but insisted on doing each item one at a time cause she refuse\couldnt up the total change.


When she finally finished, I smiled and thanked her, said i hope she has a great day ect.
She just dropped the receipt on the floor and walked away without so much as a cheers.

She has a budget.... Even though she didnt know how much money she had or even how to count it."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d80pwg/no_i_have_to_buy_it_from_you/,"“NO, I HAVE TO BUY IT FROM YOU!” This happened many months ago while I was at work. I manage a construction company specializing in flooring. We also have a showroom and we also sell just the flooring materials, so when I started reading this sub, I realized that unfortunately, I do work in retail. 

I had originally posted this in r/narcsinthewild, but I thought it also fits here. Let me know if it doesn’t. This is about a lady who was doing a favor for her husband, who is also a contractor. I’ll warn you now that she is incapable of finishing a sentence without swearing and this is not how I treat my customers. I do have the authority to ask people to leave, but rarely need to. I’ve never had a customer like this or since. She came into my showroom looking to purchase a small amount of floor tiles for a repair. She had come into the store a few times before to verify the color, so I’ve seen her before, but never interacted with her. I count myself lucky. 


On the day she came in to purchase the flooring my boss was out of the office, so I’ve been in the showroom all day by myself. This lady, annnnd that’s being *generous*, was yelling and being so offensive and so far *beyond rude* you’d need a map to get back to civility.


- She had a problem with having to buy more tiles than she needed. Boxes have a set amount of square feet. You can’t break them up. She should know this.
- She was angry about the flat-rate freight charge claiming she’d rather drive to [distribution center located 3 hours away] and pick it up herself. No. Absolutely *no way* am I subjecting my distributor to her tantrums.
- She called her husband a total of *4 times* complaining and cursing about me right in front of my face.
- She kept asking me questions about the process, timeframe, freight, etc.
- She interrupted. Every. Single. Answer. To. Every. Question. She. Asked.


She has been yelling for a solid 5 minutes when I finally picked my jaw up off the floor. Y'all, I LOST it. It’s one of the few times I’ve lost it, *especially* with a customer.  I’m a mellow person and I hardly ever speak to people like this. It takes *a lot* to offend me.  I’m a petite woman and often appear vulnerable, which is definitely *not* the word that anyone who knows me would use to describe me.  If I do happen to get angry, I have a low shiver-me-timbers-scary-whisper voice. And if you hear it, oh boy, you done messed something up good.


Lady:  I can’t *BELIEVE* how many *F-ING TIMES* I’ve come *HERE TODAY* and the store is *F-ING CLOSED!*  (Ha! Liar! I’ve been here all day!)  I have my *OWN*  business and if I ran *MY* compa - 


Me: Look lady. I think it would be a good idea for you to get your flooring from a different store.



Lady: I *CAN’T!!* I can't go somewhere *ELSE*!!! I was referred *HERE!!* I *F-ING HAVE* to get it from *YOU!!*


I’m positive I had a very confused look on my face because when I replied with:



Me: Let me get this straight... You’re treating me this way *and* you *want something from me?!*



She was incensed. 



Lady: *I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU F-ING PEOPLE!!  HOW F-ING HARD IS IT TO -* 



Oh, no. No, no, no. I don’t have security to call to help me. I have to deal with her myself and she clearly only speaks “scream.” 


I then slowly stood up from my desk, planted my hands on the table, and loomed my short little self over her, just to have my next statement sink in as deep as possible. I can dish it right back, should I need to. I have to, or I would be terrible at my job. Petite female + construction industry = Hard. In a calm and icy voice I instructed her that this is going to go *exactly* how I say. 


Me: You have 2 options. You can *sit down* and *shut up* or you can *get out*. If you want *me* to help *you*, you're going to lose the attitude *right now* or you can go throw a temper tantrum *somewhere else*. Can you do that? 


Lady: \*face puckered up like she’s been sucking on lemons for 30 years\* Whatever, I guess.


Me: NO. No *""whatever.""* No ""*I guess.*"" Is there going to be and issue again or can you park the attitude for *5 minutes*, so I can do my job *without* being verbally abused and assaulted? 



Lady: \*Catbuttface for daaaaays\* Fine.



She’s still acting rudely, complaining and mumbling that I need to hurry up because she “just wants to get her groceries home.” Seriously, lady? That's the motivation behind this BS? Seven times, she said this. Seven! I counted! Then please tell me *why* did you go grocery shopping *before* you came to order flooring?!  So, I finish writing up her order and she hands me money. As she’s leaving, she starts up again.



Lady: I’m *USUALLY* not a btch. I’m never *REALLY* a btch. I’m just *stressed out ,* so *THAT'S*  why I'm yelling, but I am *NOT* a btch.


Me: \*smh, chuckling\*  Sure, lady. Whatever, but I don’t buy that *for a second.* 



Lady: \*EPIC LEVELS OF CATBUTTFACE\*



Me: Yah know, you catch more flies with honey....just saying. (I know I shouldn’t have said this, but why not at this point.)



Lady: YEAH WELL I JUST - 



Me: *BYE!!!*



Lady: BUT YOU - 



Me: *GET. OUT. OF. MY. STORE.*


And she did.


She left having no idea when her flooring is being delivered.


A week later, her husband, who she was ~~earning a one way ticket to hell~~ running the errand for, came in waving the sales ticket inches from my face, like I'd EVER forget these people, to see when the flooring was going to arrive, because his wife surely doesn't know. *Maaaayyybeeee* in a few days, I say to myself. I hadn’t bothered to order it yet. It takes a day to ship so, I tell him the day after tomorrow. Now before y’all get cross with me for not ordering the material they paid for, I didn’t mess with the guy’s business. I knew what day he needed it by, and I definitely would have ordered it on time, but I was so appalled by her behavior that I put her on the back burner.


A couple days later, the husband’s employee comes in to pick it up. We shared an “I know, right?” look with each other. We definitely both have crazy bosses. He left, and my life went back to just it’s usual level of guano loco."

I can literally get fired for breaking this rule, it's a huge privacy issue.

So anyways, today I (M) was trying to communicate this to a customer (C).

C: calls saying they have an issue with their account

C: sounded confused but hung up pretty quickly. Called a few minutes later ""why cant you verify me over the phone? Anytime I have an issue I always get help on the phone!""

M: I understand sir, and you can get help over the phone, you just need to call 611 since theres no way I can verif-*click*

C:calls back a few minutes later ""i want to speak to the manager""

M: ""he's off for the next two days, but I can write your name and number down and he can give you a call when he returns""

A man came up to me asking where he could find hamburger buns. I told him it was with the bread, “where is the bread?” It is all the way in the bad. I even pointed. The man said he couldn’t hear me. 

I raised by voice believing I was not speaking loud enough, “Where is that?” Told him again by simply repeating myself and pointing. He was still confused and I repeated myself a few times and eventually he got me flustered to the point he no longer wanted to hear my answer. He told me he didn’t like my attitude and walked away.

This guy was simply lazy. I later heard him asking for the hamburger buns at the register. He made a scene for no reason. People were begging to stare at us while we talked.

What did I do he did not like? He asked a question and I gave him the answer. I try to be firm in my answers because many people get upset with being told we don’t have what they want. Seriously gets annoying hearing someone ask the same question less than 5 minutes after me over the radio and someone saying exactly what I already told the customer."

I answered her question twice about the x for $xx deal we had with the panties.  It wasn't hard to understand you got this many, for this price.  Onto the fun part....

I rang up customer with a few pairs of panties, then ordered one and our register gave her the deal automatically.  I said to her that she will see her in store stuff on one barcode, and ordered item above a different one, but the ending total and deal will still be the same.  Rang up her other items, she looked at the screen, paid, and left.  I then see an hour and a half later, my manager was on the phone with someone for 20 minutes, walking around, trying to figure something out.  I was busy tending to in-store customers.  

She tells me later the lady called to complain about me because, and I quote, ""the lady who rang me up told me my shirts were half off and they didn't come up that way now that I look at my receipt.  Also, (some other thing) was supposed to be on sale and it wasn't either.  I don't see where I got my x for $xx panties like she said!""  The funny part?  She never asked me about her other clothing items.  My manager asked me about the interaction and I told her all this.  Manager then says she knew the lady didn't have a clue because one of her items wasn't on sale, it was a completely different item type next to it with a sign, and she had to explain multiple times about the ordered vs. in-store totals, barcodes, and had to do the math for and with the woman."

Simple stuff usually, like “do you carry this” or “how much does this cost”, easy stuff. A call comes, and I think it’s pretty standard stuff. So I answer the phone.

DISCLAIMER: This happened on Friday, so I’m retelling this to the best of my ability lol, I don’t remember word for word what she said.

LADY: Boomer 
Me: Employee 

LADY: Hello?

Me: Hi, this is XYZ Company, how can I help you?

LADY: Hi, I was calling to see if you guys sell table runners. 

Me: *looks it up on my scanner gun* No sorry, we don’t, it’s an online only product. But you could always order it online and have it delivered to our store :)

I’m hoping to shoo her off at this point.  We don’t sell them, none in the back, our store just doesn’t carry it.

LADY: Are you sure? I was there last month and you guys had it. 

Me: Yeah sorry, our store doesn’t carry them. Was there anything else you needed help with?

LADY: You know what, I’m going to come in there tomorrow and if I don’t find them, I’m reporting you. What’s your name?
———-
At this point, I’m pretty pissed off, tired, and just bored. So I decide to fuck with her a little, knowing that she’s going to follow through on that threat.

I give her the name of one of my friends, who works at a completely unrelated retail chain. We’re going to call her Tammy. 

(Keep in mind there is no employee named Tammy at my store or team, so I know this is airtight.)

Me: My name is Tammy, Ma’am. 

LADY: Okay Tammy, I’ll see you tomorrow.

This happened before I came in, but according to the recount told by my one of my coworkers, she came in looking for ‘Tammy’, and insisted that it was Tammy who she talked to on the phone. 

My supervisor had to explain to her that no one named Tammy worked in the store, and god I wish I was there to see it. It sounded glorious."

To preface the story this woman and her bf (mid 30s) come in all the time and they’re clearly stoned, drunk, high you name it they’ve been in the store under the effects of it. Her bf tries to play it cool but she can’t seem to not act like a child under any circumstance. 

I was having a terrible day at work. Garbage scheduling (nothing new), extra rude people giving me attitude over their errors, people being dumb. All that jazz. I happen to walk by one of our HBC aisles, which is ideally placed in the front of the store, and I happen to notice one customer on her knees holding a stack of shaving products, probably $50 worth. She was trying to adjust her purse to get them to fit in while hiding behind a 2 tier basket. Which is like hiding behind a chain link fence. You can see everything. 

It was like watching a toddler attempt to put a square peg into a round hole. She just couldn’t do it. I stood back and watched while she tried. After 10s I walked up and asked her if I could help her with anything. I saw the cogs in her brain work their hardest to not freak out and make a bs excuse. 

The first thing she told me was that she was trying to read the back of the items to get a better understanding of them. Mmhm, yea I didn’t know you need to be on your knees to do that. After that she let out nervous laugh and then told me she was about to ask me a stupid question. “Do you know anything about these products?”  I strait up said no. Unfortunately I was pulled aside by a self check out needing help to correct a mistake. I bolted back there but didn’t see her put everything away. Though I did see one item left behind on the top of the basket. 

After that she disappeared like a fart in the wind. We couldn’t find her. A few minutes later she and her bf came out of the men’s bathroom together. I can only imagine what they were doing in there. She began browsing the discount rack and was making a small scene with her bf. I pointed out who the attempted shoplifter was to my manager. We kept a close eye on her until she left. 

Oddly enough she came back into the store about an hour later but with her parents. She gunned back to that same aisle and told her mother she wanted her to buy the items she couldn’t steal. Sadly enough her mother who was in her 60s bought it all for her. She then checked the discount rack but decided against getting stuff seeing how she’d have to wait in a line. Nothing else happened after that. 

Hopefully she won’t show her face in the store again but I doubt it. I’ll keep my eyes peeled."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d7ikqo/you_should_find_another_job/,"""You should find another job"" It's been a few weeks since this happened, but I'm over it. I work at a grocery store with online pickups where people pick their groceries up for **FREE**. No charges at all.

Well, on this fateful day, I was working the closing shift. We were horribly understaffed so I was working alone. We still have a few orders that haven't been picked yet for 8 to 10 and it was already 7pm when 3 customers came in at the same time. We have a first come, first serve basis so whoever calls our department for pickup first, gets their order first. It usually takes 3 - 10 minutes to load each customer (unless the system goes down and we have to manually scan each and every item which takes forever).  I also tell customers when there are people ahead of them so they know when they're gonna expect a few minutes of wait.

So, I start loading these 3 customers in order. Lady 1 was thankful for me loading her groceries into her trunk without having to get out. No problems at all. Mind you, it only took me 4 minutes to load her. Now I start loading Lady 2's groceries. I got to her car and she comes out. You can immediately see that she was in a bad mood. No worries, we all have our days, right?

**Lady 2**: ""Why did it take you so long to load my groceries?""

**Me**: ""I apologize, but I cannot get to everyone immediately. Lady 1 called first so she got her groceries first. Plus, I'm working alone right now"".

**Lady 2**: *sighs* ""Alright. Just load mine quick. I have to tuck my kids in soon.""

Reasonable enough. Let's say it took me between 7-10 minutes loading hers since it was a huge load. She thanked me and drove off. Now, I start loading Lady 3's order. She also had a huge order so it took me a couple of minutes to get to her. As I get her order out of our department's door, I see her stomping towards me. She was angry. I know she was, but I really wasn't expecting it. I was tired. I've been working since 12:00pm and I had to rush my lunch and not take any 15 minute breaks (atleast until the end of my shift where everything slows down). I wasn't able to say anything back until she took a deep breath after a few minutes of her rant.

**Lady 3**: *insert really long rant about how long her wait is, how she has chores to do still, and that we should compensate her for her time.*

**Me**: ""Miss, I'm really sorry about the long wait. I had to load to customers ahead of you and I'm currently alone-""

**Lady 3**: ""Well, maybe you should schedule more people then!""

**Me**: ""I can't do that, miss. I'm not the department manager, and I don't decide who works when.""

**Lady 3**: ""I don't care! I'm expecting a full refund for this. You and your department are incapable of accommodating your customer's needs!""

A full refund of 600$ worth of groceries with no pickup fees? For 15 minutes of her time?

**Me**: ""I can't issue you a full refund. I can get you a 10$ voucher for the inconvenience, but a full refund is impossible. And as I said earlier, I was working alone.""

**Lady 3**: ""You should find another job if you can't load all of us under 5 minutes. And if you won't issue the full refund, I'll take this to the head manager and I'm getting you fired!""

I just stood there, shocked. I wasn't able to respond at all.

**Lady 3**: ""Now put all my groceries into the back of the car. You've wasted too much of my time already! I hope they fire you.""

She went back into her car, and I just loaded her as fast as I could, cause I just don't wanna deal with this anymore. After she drove off, I sent an email to our department manager regarding this and they sent her a 25$ voucher cause ""customers are always right"".

Maybe I should really find another job..."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d7ms5x/angry_chicken_salad_wednesday/,"Angry Chicken Salad Wednesday Hey all,

Back story:

I work in a grocery store deli and I great quality equipment to work with in excellent condition, but now and again you'll have something out of your control like broken a slicer, fryer, or oven. In this case it was a broken salad case. we had to pull the salads from the front and not use them, except three different salads available while the case was broken. We still had customers ask about the salads. We just said we have three salads available at the moment due to the broken salad case Potato salad, Macaroni salad, and Chicken Caesar salad.

&#x200B;

Now the Story:

It's been a few days and we're still waiting on the repair tech to come fix the salad case. A customer comes up and asks for some sliced meats and I slice the meats. The customer then asks ""do you guys have any of the salads today?"" ""yes sir, I do have a few salads available"" and that's where I made the mistake ""can I have chicken salad"" at this moment I knew I... HAD... DUN... GOOFED!!! I didn't say what salads we had available and now I'm going to die for it. ""I don't have chicken salad but I do..."" i was cut off mid sentence by the anger that ensued ""YOU DON'T HAVE CHICKEN SALAD, IT'S WEDNESDAY AND YOU DON'T CHICKEN SALAD"" this customer has just went from calm to over 9000 anger level. ""I'M GOING TO TO TO"" he picks up a sign and throws it at me I duck down and he walks away angry as HELL. I pick up the sign and place it back where it was and get on the phone with my manager to inform him what had just transpired in my deli after I get paged on the store intercom. 

I still wish the customer well and hold no hard feelings about what had happened. I'm just glad it didn't get worse that what is was."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d7kzvw/power_went_out/,"Power went out (: Last hour of work, everything was going great, aaaaand the power went out as I was about to swipe a debit card. I remembered her total, did a cash transaction instead, and waited for further instruction.

We waited, the power didn't come back on. So we instructed everybody to leave their things for us to put away. With no power, there's nothing we can do. It would have been too tedious and messy to ring up the items on a calculator.

You've already guessed what happened next. A little lady grabbed the last few items and tired to check out. I'm not sure she understood that the power went out, which is a bit saddening, but all I could do was try to reexplain. 

Her husband turned around and told her something along the lines of ""honey we'll come back for our things, it's time to go."" What a sweet old man.

She asked me to hold her items, but the senior cashier said it would be unfair to the others. She'll find them when we reopen.

Bonus story I already knew would happen:

After work, I went to grab the rest of my groceries. Working at a popular store in a small town, a lot of people see me daily-weekly. I knew all too well what was bound to happen.

A guy who was shopping with his family asked""Did the power ever come back on?"" ""Nope, but I figured someone here would ask. It's down for the day."" ""Oh well, we'll be back this week!"" And his family kept shopping.

I'll have to cash out the register when I come back to work. Oh well, it could have been a lot worse. Nobody got hurt, and we only had an hour left, if that. The timing could have been a lot worse than it was."

Also gift cards are 13 digits long and the start of the pin is pre entered.


C = customer M = me

M : Good afternoon how can i help you?

C = YOUR GIFT CARD SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING ONLINE. IT WONT ACCEPT MY GIFT CARD NUMBER.

m = I'm sorry to hear this can i take the gift card number to check it on my end as we have no issues currently with is

*gives gift card number* it works perfectly fine on my end

Me = it has inputted for me are you sure you're inputting it correctly?

C = of course i am, it would work for me if there was enough boxes to input it. There is only 4 !

* me at this point at bit confused* 

Me= There should only be 4 boxes and 1 for the pin....

C = There isn't enough your system is broken!

*the customer comes back after a minute*

C = oh wait you have to put more than one digit in each box... pity it doesn't tell you that. It's very confusing.

Customer closes chat lol

Summary: customer can't enter gift card gets a bit angry. Thinks you need to put one digit in each of the 4 boxes for a 13 digit pin.."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d7iktr/just_bad_at_shoplifting/,"Just bad at shoplifting Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I work in an independent record store that sells a bit of everything: vinyl records, CDs, DVDs, cassettes, band shirts and memorabilia, all that stuff. Today, right when we opened, we had a particularly skeevy looking dude come in. He wandered around the store, picked up a few CDs and a T-shirt. He comes up to the front counter to check out and pays for his stuff but he sets off our alarm when he goes to walk out. So, my coworker, assuming she just forgot to zap an antitheft device, takes his bag and puts it on our demagnetiser and hands it back to him. He still beeps at the front door, which gets my manager's attention.

So she has him empty his pockets and walk through without the bag. Still beeps. At this point,  it's obvious that he's trying to steal something but he plays dumb. She asks him to show her his waistband, which he refuses. At this point, I look at my manager and mouth ""do you want me to call the cops?"". ""Not yet."" she mouthes back. While she's turned to me, he pulls an action figure from his waist and puts it on the counter. So there we have it. He tries to act like everything's fine.

Nah, bitch.

Our general manager is gung ho about us prosecuting shoplifters, so we call the cops. Which the guy is clearly not stoked about because he ""gave it back"" (the item he attempted to steal in the first place). Then he gives us a sob story about how he has a prior for vandalism and he'll go to jail if he gets caught for shop lifting. Which, I mean, c'mon. The fact that you're a career idiot doesn't make me feel bad for you. If you were stealing something essential like food for your family, I'd have a ton of sympathy. But nah, you stole a stupid plastic toy. 

The real kicker though: the item he attempted to steal has an obvious anti-theft device stuck to the back of it AND one of my coworkers knew the guy. Maybe consider shoplifting somewhere where they don't know you personally and/or consider stealing an item that isn't tagged.

But it's not like we could just hold him there so he runs out to his car and takes off. The cops come and we give them his description and his car's description - we're told an investigator will get into contact with us.

All of this happened within an hour of us being open. Weird Saturday, man.

We got our action figure back though."

So for context to the story I am an 18 y/o male cashier for a popular North American clothing retailer, and am commonly listed as the top performer in credit card sales and in email capture. Again a disclaimer, I'm on my phone so I'm very sorry for the horrid formatting. 

Anywho, this is less a story than it is a common occurrence that truly confuses me, and I notice it especially when it's a slow day and nobody is in a hurry. Here, let me just show you this way...

Me: ""Hello, I hope you found everything alright today."" *At this point I'm already scanning and folding the items.*

C: ""Oh yes, thank you."" *Customer helps me to remove the hangers.*

At this point, if it's a short transaction we're already done, but I have a spiel that I have to say at some point of the transaction. Keep in mind on the card terminal there's a list of the items and the grand total.

Me: ""Alright so your grand total for today is going to be $69.69."" *Customer inserts card, staring at the terminal. I'm obviously not done talking, though.* ""However, if you'd like the price to be smaller, you can sign up for the brand credit card to get yourself about 42.0% off. It only takes about ninety seconds and offers--"" I'm often interrupted.

C: ""Why isn't it working? I put my card in.""

It's normally either that or *Swipes card, puts card away, then looks at me, wanting their bag.* (I don't bag items or give them to the customer until the items are paid for and a receipt is printed) Then after my spiel, I instruct them to slide or insert the card when the blue lights flash. And the FAQ for that scenario is 

C: ""Will this charge my card twice??""

And for those with the same question, no.. No, it won't. 

I don't know if at other retailers it automatically processes the card without a cashier pressing the go-ahead button but we always have to send the instructions to the terminal manually at all of these locations. And more often than not, these are regular customers. 

If someone could tell me if that's impatience or possibly a lack of understanding how the technology works, that'd be great. It doesn't really aggravate me, it's just so common, and it does slightly annoy me, but that's only when it's a busy day and it slows down the line. 

Anywho, thanks for reading my Ted talk."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d6ykqg/i_thought_it_was_a_fancy_humidifier/,"“I Thought It Was A Fancy Humidifier!” So I work at an older women’s clothing store, and as many clothing stores do, we have an industrial steamer to get the wrinkles out of new products so they look presentable. We also have to steam the products next to the registers because we don’t have enough staff to be prepping things in the back. 

If you’ve never used a steamer before, they get insanely hot. You can very easily burn yourself if you’re not careful, even just putting it five inches away from your skin long enough can give you a nice red mark. 

Now onto the story, a younger girl and her friend were browsing products near our registers while I was steaming some shirts to be put out. I noticed one of the shirts was missing a sensor, so I turned to grab a set, and while I was walking the five steps back I noticed the girls making a beeline for the steamer.

I swear it was almost a slow motion moment, my brain couldn’t register fast enough that the girl was reaching to GRAB onto the steamers head! She held onto it for around 2 seconds before she yelped and jumped back, “Oh my god it’s hot!”

I stood there in disbelief for a second that this girl literally just decided to grab a steamer. “Are you okay?!” I said, still dumbstruck. 

“Yeah I’m fine, I just thought it was a fancy humidifier!” The girl and her friend turned to leave, laughing at what she just did the whole way out. 

Thankfully she was fine, but I still don’t know why she thought a store would have a humidifier, nonetheless reach to grab the source of the steam! Ever since I’ve been super anxious when people even get close to it when it’s on."

All had tags. All were duplicates and had sensor damage. Sizes ranged from XS to XL, but she claimed her daughter bought it all and none of it fit. We aren’t allowed to turn away any returns no matter what. 

Since she didn’t have a receipt I had to put it on a gift card. (They don’t care because then they use the gift card, return everything and get the money) She got back more than $300. 

She also mentioned that she usually beeps on her way in and out of stores because of her bag. She told me she was surprised she didn’t beep on the way in, but that she’ll probably beep on the way out. I laughed my ass off as soon as she walked away because it was hilarious to me and everyone else around that she would say such a thing. Basically telling me she was going to steal. 

We also aren’t supposed to say or do anything. You have to laugh or else you’ll just get frustrated. 

She left. Didn’t beep. Came back in and bought a $10.00 t-shirt after trying on a mountain of clothes and walking around the store for almost an hour. She beeped on the way out. No surprise there. 

Another store told us she seems to be hiding things not only in her bag, but somehow under her very long skirt that she was in fact wearing when she came in. 

She called not even an hour later saying she lost her gift card and wanted to know if she could come in again so we could issue her a new one. My manager knew exactly what was going on and even though she could get in trouble for it, she gave the woman our customer service number  and told her to talk to them. The woman got noticeably angry and said it was ridiculous. 

We were told afterwards customer service would cancel the old gift card before issuing her a new one which was good news. 

She came in later that week to try things on, but not buy anything. She beeped on the way out so our store manager followed her outside to see her license plate because apparently, that’s how our other stores have been doing it. “Anonymously” call the police and basically say we are workers but not to tell corporate we called. The only problem was that she had a driver and he sped out of there before sm even got outside."

She would make grandiose claims that she worked for the store, she was in our loss prevention, she was a police officer, she was a doctor, she was a lawyer, she was in the government, etc. Creating problems but not significant enough she was a major issue.

We took to referring to her as ""crazy Asian lady"" when discussing our interactions.

Nobody had seen her for a long time and the last month or so she's been showing up again. She's always in different clothes now. She doesn't make grandiose claims of her employment. She's.... Pretty normal.

Obviously since Georgia law requires anyone who physically brings alcohol up to the counter with the intent of it being purchased in any fashion, I have to check her ID. So, I ask for the ID.

Guy: No, she's not buying it.

Me: Well she brought it to the register so, by law I have to see her ID and confirm she's 21.

Guy: This is my daughter and the beer is for my wife.

The guy then pulls out a police badge and places it on the counter. I pause in disbelief. I think ""Is this guy really trying to do this?"" So, we then go back and fourth about how the beer cannot be purchased and he even tries the old ""what if she goes wait in the car or if she puts the beer back and I bring it to the register""

Me: It's like this: You being an officer of the law should know what the laws are. The fact you're putting me in this position is pretty inconsiderate. And, I cannot in any way sell you this 6 pack.

Well, eventually he concedes. It was never really a major argument. Wish I could say some more crazy stuff happened, but no. There is this one little bit of info though: I later found out the officer was of top rank of a neighboring city. Not gonna get into any specifics other than that.

He was a real cop. I told my boss what happened thinking we can have a good laugh about it. She knew who I was talking about because she saw him moments before this happened. Also, he lives down the street from her.

As far as calling 911 or making a complaint it never crossed my mind. Especially since when he conceded it seemed like he was happy I did my job. Plus, he very well have been buying it for his wife after all and his daughter just got overzealous and grabbed it for him."

This happened a few years ago when I had just started my personal Hell that is a career in retail, but I remember it as if it was yesterday.

I worked at a local grocery store next to a housing estate, so we would get pretty regular customers. Over the course of a few weeks, this one customer sporadically came in to do some shopping. Pretty normal so far right?

The guy had no arms.

He would use one arm stump to carry the basket and when getting something from the shelves, he would use his feet as if they were his hands.

Know what else he done with his feet? Pay for his goods at the checkout. He had the bottoms of his jeans turned up to use as pockets and would rummage for coins or notes and pass them over between his toes.

Absolutey disgusting yet kind of fascinating at the same time.

Anyway...he was in doing his thing one day and I was on the checkout, mentally preparing myself for when he was done. My supervisor was with me and we were just chatting. She sees him trying to get a bag of sweets off the shelves, turns to him and asks....

...""Do you need a hand?""

I don't know what he said in reply mainly because
I was too busy chewing my lip to stop myself bursting out laughing at the till. 

They had their exchange and he went back to shopping and I turned to my supervisor and asked if she had realised what she just said. 

She was mortified and said the words just came out before she even realised. 

I often wonder whatever happened to that guy.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d631p1/my_first_pharmacy_experience/,"My First Pharmacy Experience This is a tale about a customer who was so off her knockers that a fight nearly ensued. Now I can't give away too much information (HIPAA) but what I can tell you is that this took place the first day I worked in the pharmacy. I do need to give some background first.

When I started working in this store, I started out as just a measly cashier. As the months went by, I started getting small position changes. Some days I'd be working more in the photo department, and other days I'd be working on projects that my boss would give me instead of cashiering the whole day. After about a year of working at this store, I was offered a position to where I'd not only help in the front of the store, but I'd be helping in the pharmacy too. I was helping fill and dispense prescriptions. I was basically a non-licensed pharmacy tech with entry level skills. There was a raise involved so I took the position. In the weeks following that promotion, I was being trained on the various work stations in the pharmacy.

&#x200B;

Finally I'd gotten a portion of one of my shifts working in the pharmacy with minimal help for the first time. I felt so anxious and exhilarated at the same time. My first customer was an elderly lady who was simply picking up a prescription. At first she seemed so harmless and docile. I asked for her last name and everything. She was so compliant. As I was looking at her prescription information, I was terrified because the script had a TPR (Third Party Rejection). Looking at the notes, for whatever reason, her insurance company wasn't covering her prescription and this was for a certain controlled substance. I relayed this to the customer as delicate as I could and she absolutely blew up.

C = Customer

M = Myself

P = Pharmacist

O = Officer

C: WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY INSURANCE STOPPED COVERING THIS? I'VE TAKEN THIS FOR SEVEN YEARS! YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG! LET ME TALK TO THE PHARMACIST!

M: Okay I'm sorry! I'll let you speak to her!

I called the pharmacist over and explained the situation. She looked up the script on her own computer and had seen an error code next to the rejection that only she knew (I think I was supposed to know what it meant too but I was clueless).

P: Okay so it looks like you need to set up an appointment with your doctor. Then your doctor will authorize another prescription for you and we can fill it.

C: I'M MOVING OUT OF THE COUNTRY SOON AND I CAN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR! THIS IS ABSOLUTE BULLS\*\*T! CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE ME A PERMANENT VACATION OVERRIDE OR SOMETHING?

P: No ma'am we can't. It's against policy for us to do that. Are you going on vacation or are you actually moving?

C: I'M MOVING!

P: So unfortunately since you're moving, there isn't anything we can do on our end. I'm sorry.

C: YOU MOTHERF\*\*\*ER! I WANT MY SCRIPT NOW!

She started picking up the scan gun at the pharmacy window register and threw it back at the pharmacist. I immediately went into a ""fight or flight"" response and backed up as far as I was able to.

P: Ma'am we have to ask you to leave the store now or we will call the police.

C: I AM NOT LEAVING! GIVE ME MY MEDICINE!

I was backed up against the wall, terrified of what this lady could have done. She was screaming threat after threat at myself and the pharmacist. Other customers were watching the incident from afar and didn't come any closer. They had a right to be scared. The pharmacist gave me a signal to call the store manager from a different phone. I do so from a phone that's up against the drive thru window. The manager was surprised but gave me the go ahead to call the police. After describing the threat to dispatch, they offered to send two officers to the store. They do so very quickly. It took them about five minutes. In that five minutes, she nearly got on the counter and tried to lunge at the pharmacist. Like holy crap this elderly woman was super limber and agile for her appearance and age. I freaked out and ran to the back of the pharmacy where the break room door was. I was afraid she'd gotten into the pharmacy and started wrecking the snot out of everything. I immediately heard ""GET ON THE GROUND WITH YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD"" from an unfamiliar voice. It was the voice of an officer. They were subduing and arresting that lady. She never made it over the counter but instead cracked one of her hips trying to get on it.

O: Sir you can come out from back there. the area is safe.

I walk out and the second officer is escorting the lady out of the store. I answer some questions from the officer and they leave the store about twenty minutes later. I was absolutely traumatized. I'd never experienced anything like that in the four years I'd worked retail. The store manager asked me if I was okay to continue working or if I wanted to go home for the day. I asked to keep working. I was extremely wary and on edge for the rest of my shift.

Needless to say, I'm always extremely hyper vigilant when I'm working back there now. Drugs are scary but people are scarier. That first day was the worst first day (so far)."

I knocked on the door and asked if she was alright. She just told me, clearly frightened, that the door was stuck. I asked her to slow down, and check the bolts. She said they're already disengaged. I say, okay, now push on the door. I heard a strain on the door, but it did not budge. Weird, but we can get through this!

I asked her if I could try the door, and after she agreed, I pulled from my end and met absolutely zero resistance.

That whole time.

That whole effort.

Without saying where I work, I'll just say that my store's products are sold other places besides my store, like in big department stores and such. Sometimes the products are the same, sometimes they carry things we don't.  


This woman comes in telling me she saw one of our bags at ""big department store"" and asked if we could match their price. Usually, yes, we can because usually the item is older and needs to be on sale anyway but the bag she was talking about was rather new so I figured ""What price could it possibly be somewhere else? It's not already on sale, is it?""   


I asked her what the price was at **big department store** and she said ""They're having a 30% off friends and family sale, so it's 30% off!"" Umm...no. Big department store was having their own sale, we were not, so she was basically asking us if we could give her their discount. Why, just why? If it's on sale there, go buy it there!   


When I told her no she got upset, by the way."

I was sent up front for the last hour of my shift to fix up the Halloween section. I accepted knowing I was almost done and it was something else to do. I went up to see a mom with two little kids, one about 3 and another about 6. They were running around without shoes and yelling. The mom was too busy looking at Halloween wigs and costumes. The younger child had gotten a plastic scythe and was running around with it and banging it on the ground. I went into an aisle they weren’t in to put things away. Meanwhile, these children are still running around the next aisle and I hear the banging and mom just lets it go. 

All of a sudden the children run behind me and the little girl hits me with the plastic scythe in the back. Our policy is to get management in situations like this but I had no luck. Afterwards I heard and saw the children trying on masks and throwing them on the ground all the while mom was not paying any attention. I then heard the older girl tell the younger one she broke the scythe she was holding and only then did mom step in and start disciplining them and took them away.

Now that that's out of the way, let me give some backstory. I've been thoroughly invested in this subreddit and didn't think I would ever have a story to share, but now I do! I recently started a part-time job at a large chain retail store, mainly sells clothes but dabbles in electronics and toys. Anyway, our store is in a pretty well off socio-economic area so we tend not to get *too* many thefts. On to the story!

&#x200B;

Yesterday a lady came in with her kid (maybe 8 or 9?) And the kid led her straight to the toy section were she promptly  began a loud conversation with somebody over her phone. (I'm working the register but have a clear view to pretty much the entire store) While this is happening the kid behaves like a kid and begins pulling all sorts of toys off the shelf to show his mother, who ignores everything and continues chatting away. I quickly lose interest and help out some customers. Soon afterwards I see them walking towards the exit again, the mother is still on her phone, but I notice the kid has some sort of Pokemon TCG pack in his hands (I used to collect the cards but don't anymore, I didn't realize they even still made them) I know they haven't paid for it and as they're about to walk out of the store I run over and try to tell the Mom about the kid still having the pack. Of course it takes me a couple of attempts to actually get her to listen and stop talking on her phone. Finally she tells whoever she's talking to that she would have to hang up because ""Some employee is harassing me"" Fun times ensue:

**Me:** (Hilarious joke about who this could be)

**IM:** Ignorant Mother

&#x200B;

**Me:** Excuse me miss your child has a Pokemon card pack he hasn't payed for

**IM:** *Looks at me like I'm some sort of alien life form* A what now?

**Me:** It's a toy from this store, you haven't paid for it yet

**IM:** Are you saying my kid is stealing something?

**Me:** *Dies Internally* Not at all miss I just think you may have forgotten to pay is all

**IM:** I would never forget to pay for something *Begins walking away*

&#x200B;

At this point I probably could have (and should have) gone after them but I suffer from pretty bad social anxiety (I know, retail job + anxiety = Bad) But I just tell my manager about it and offer to pay the price of the pack ($6 I think it was) But my manager says that it was fine (he's nice and understands my anxiety) and tells me if I see her again to come get him.

&#x200B;

Next day rolls around (Today at the time of posting this) and I see her come back into the store with her kid. I go and grab the manager like I was told to and as I come back with him overhear this conversation:

**IM:** Ignorant Mother

**C2:** Cashier 2

&#x200B;

**IM:** Excuse me my son bought (stole) these Pokemon cards yesterday and my son says he didn't get the cards he wanted so I would like a refund

**C2 (Who has an understanding of how Pokemon booster packs work apparently):** Unfortunately Pokemon packs aren't guaranteed to get you the cards you want, they're all randomized.

**IM:** *Alien look again* What?

***Manager (M) steps in***

**M:** Excuse me miss I'm going to have to ask you to leave this store. My employee here (Me) told me about you stealing that pack

**IM:** *Pikachu (haha) surprised face* I did not steal anything!

**M:** Unfortunately miss we have surveillance feeds of the entire incident, so I'm going to have to ask you once again to leave or the police will be called

*IM just runs out of the store, leaving the cards on the cashier bench*

&#x200B;

Sorry there isn't any amazing ending with the police being called or a fight breaking out. But I hope to bring you more stories from my job if and when they happen! :D

So I tell him what we have in stock and am cutoff again by rdc saying it has to be Samsung so I tell him about the j series and chooses the only one we have so I go get it to show him and after I return ask him if he wants payments or buy it straight out (earlier he said he didn't want payments but I still asked out of habit). He replies in a rude attitude saying ""I told you no payments"" alright the phone will be 250 he looks at me and says the to expensive 3 years ago I bought a phone for my father for 40 dollars which I respond we don't have an Samsung phones that cheap (we have prepaid but there is a couple month span before you can switch the phones over to another carrier). He points at the prepaids and says what are these while I try to explain the process he would have to do to get that switched to his plan and he cuts me off ""you are not helpful at all how do you even work here where is your manger"" and gets mad that I don't have a manger at the store and storms off while grunting ""ya ill find a manger"" . So I figure it happens and wait as expected a matm comes up and calls me to the front  luckily she is laid back so I have to deal with the manger for about 10 min trying to give my side of the story, explain what happened and tell the matm that he constantly cut me off not letting me explain the manger relaxes I ask where the customer is only to hear that he stormed out already I hope that's the last time I hear from him because dealing with him for 30 min close to end of my shift was wearing out that last of my patience for customers."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d5eqyh/woman_shakes_the_bottom_of_ladder_im_standing_on/,"Woman shakes the bottom of ladder I'm standing on. I work at a large retail chain, where most of our stock that has been unboxed and unwrapped that is ready to go on the floor gets placed into overhead bins above the racks and inside the walls, usually covered and disguised by posters. This is so when stock runs low, we can very quickly replenish it.

I hate heights, but as a result, a huge part of my job is climbing up ladders to replenish stock. Last week we were out of stock of (item), and it just happened to be on the highest shelf of the excess stock, so I had to use the tallest ladder, which is about 2m (?), or 6.5 foot. Basically, the height of an impressively tall man from lowest to highest usable step. Again, I really do not like heights. I understand to a lot of people, this may not seem very high, but I am always extremely stressed doing this, and my biggest fear has *always* been, since I started this position, some dumb karen coming over and knocking me over.

Last week, my head inside the shelf, standing on top of the ladder, I feel someone at the bottom pushing and pulling. I instantly pull my head out of the shelf, clutching the item, and grasp onto the handle at the top of the ladder. I can literally hear my heart beating inside my head. I look down, gasping for air, and its some dumb youngish woman, about 23-24, smiling up at me, completely oblivious to how fucked up of a thing that is to do to someone.

""hehe! just checking it's sturdy! nice work!""

I was really shocked bc to see someone around my age being such a karen threw me off, but it was the fact she was so oblivious to why shaking a 2m ladder someone was standing on *wasn't ok*. In my nightmare situation it was always a Karen at the bottom, going ""yoo hoo!!! what do I need to do to get some assistance in here!!!!"" or something along those lines. After she stopped shaking, she walked away and I (slowly) climbed down.

I turned my back to quickly replenish the stock I'd pulled (it only takes ten seconds and I'd already gone to all that trouble) and when I went to walk around to find my manager I couldn't find one, nor could I see the woman. I told a coworker I needed a bathroom break but I really just needed to calm down, and when I came back the woman had definitely left the store, and I kinda just let it slide I guess. I don't really have a super comfortable relationship w supervisors or managers at my place, so I figured if I see her again I'll have a polite but firm conversation, but I probably won't. Sometimes I just don't understand what's wrong with people.

EDIT: I think a lot of you are really right I should've had a spotter. I think it's just one of those things where everyone in my workplace is so chill with it and treats it like it's so normal I never even really thought about it enough. I don't live in the US so I can't contact OSHA. I think the course of action I'm most comfortable with is just not replenishing overhead unless someone is in the aisle with me, and if it get's brought up I'll do as you said about refusing a task if it's dangerous. I feel silly now because I feel like in my workplace they wouldn't even bring it up, let alone notice and I shouldn't have been putting myself at risk this whole time. Also as far as retail goes, I actually quite like this job, and otherwise it really suits me. It sucks in situations like this when no manager is around but on the other hand I can kinda just mess around for a lot of my shift and talk to my work buddy.

Also, I did want to address something I see a lot of in this sub, which is ""I would've done this, I could've done this"". On one hand, I totally understand, I definitely read stories on here and think ""I would've punched that customer"", or ""oh yeah I would've given them an ear full!"", and get all riled up. But sometimes in these situations, and I think we can all empathize, when someone starts yelling at you out of the blue, or a customer says something so insulting and abusive really unexpectedly, or shakes a ladder you're standing on and you've been working for 6 hours already so the lights are on but no ones home, it can take you a minute to even adjust to what actually just happened. It honestly wasn't even until I got into the bathroom until I actually understood what had even happened. My fight or flight started going and I think my biggest thing was just to get down from the ladder safely, and find a manager to report it (who turned out to be on a smoke break of all things)."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d5qzdw/the_tale_of_the_fraudulent_returner/,"The tale of the fraudulent returner TLDR at the bottom. 

A bit of context.  I work at a craft store, corporate cut our LP position, we use customer service to deter shop lifters. When doing a return without a receipt you get the lowest sale price and we need a form of ID.

Our cast: M=manager, FR=fraudulent returner, CO=coworker, and ME.

 Our story begins about a month ago give or take a week. I get called up to the registers fire back yo by my coworker. As we get the line down a girl(FR) comes to my register. FR has about 6 products she is returning without a receipt. I'm going through the transaction normally, no red flags yet. 

About the same time my CO needs some change and calls up M. As M was getting the change M notices a certain product in the return. She strikes up a conversation with FR.

M: so you didn't need all of this?

FR: no I was working on a project last month and this is what was left over. 

M: oh, always buy more so you return what you don't need. *picks up a certain product* Interesting we just stocked this a 2 days ago. You said you got all of this here?

FR: no I got this at a different location, like 2 weeks ago.

M: interesting this product just got shipped to the stores, no store was supposed to put them it until a specific date. Which store?

FR: I don't remember which store. 

M: ok.

I finish processing the return and send her on her merry way.  FR leaves and M tells both CO and ME to keep an eye for her. This is where most stories end and you wouldn't figure out the return is stolen product returned. The story doesn't end here, it continues today. Same exact cast, FR really didn't think. 

So today I'm covering my CO's break. FR is back and has another return. I of course recognize her. I say the normal spiel and then walkie M and tell M I need a managers approval for a return. Luckily M is a couple of aisles away and gets to the register almost immediately. M just takes over on a different register. 

M: hi I hear your returning all of this?

FR: yeah my grandma doesn't need any of it.

M: do you have the receipt?

FR: no, my grandma couldn't find it.

M: did she buy it all in this store?

FR: yes that's what she told me.

M: all on the same transaction?

FR: yup that's what grandma said. 

M: ok do you want to give me a moment to see if I can find the receipt? You would get the exact amount you paid for instead of the lowest sale price. 

FR: sure that would be awesome.

M: did your grandma happen to say when she bought all of this?

FR: uh yeah a couple of weeks ago.

M: ok I'll be right back.

Exit stage left M.

FR: I'll stand to the side so you can help the others. 

FR is grinning ear to ear like she just won the lottery. 

I take the next customer and tne starts building. I was going to call for back up, however my CO pages over the walkie she's back from break. Sweet!! 

CO gets back and takes the next customer. While both of us are finishing up with our customers, M comes back. 

M: I couldn't find any receipt are you sure it was at this store?

FR: it could have been the store closer to her house. 

M: ok then it'll have to be the lowest sale price. Is that ok?

FR: yeah that's fine. 

M processes the return, tells CO to finish it up and hands CO a return card. 

CO tries to process the return card and one small problem it's already been issued. CO calls M back. We ran out of return cards. M voids the transaction. And apologizes to FR. FR exits scene. 

M sends a mass text to every location in our district and one to the DM to inform the other locations not in our district. CO asked if that was the FR we were on the look out for because she looked just like her. 
We all agree we won't be seeing FR anytime soon. 

TLDR: a customer who is suspected of returning stolen product, gets away the first time, comes back to the same store in which the same exact staff just happened to be scheduled. Because of confidence FR doesn't get away with it and all other locations are warned.

Edit: fire back yo is meant to be paged by."

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d5audl/the_times_our_entire_store_lost_power_because_of/,"The times our entire store lost power because of the builder's carelessness The title can look pretty much self-explanatory, but the ending is not what you might think it is. It's funny, though! TL;DR at the bottom, cause I have a feeling this will be long.

So I worked at a big chain retail company for some time (gotta pay tuition, you know!). The entire chain is currently upgrading both the interior and exterior of - I think - all the stores in the world, and since my specific store is in a very small county, we started much later than the other stores (the work was already started when I began working there, though). 

For whatever reason, the store manager could not seem to find good builders, and the weeks before I started working there had been awful for the store. Why? Cause the workers apparently weren't educated enough to manage to keep the power on for more than 30 minutes continuously. Mind you, we of course have fully electronical payment systems, and not even the registers could be opened without electricity. Every time the power got cut, we had to call the electricity company, who took at least 10 minutes to come, and additional time to fix the problem. Plus, the register systems themselves took about 15-20 minutes to start up everytime. This meant a great loss in funds, since we lost SO many customers over the course of many, many weeks. 

When I got there, the power had not been fixed whatsoever, so it still cut out regularly, and my poor manager (who is SO nice) and/or colleagues had to call the electricity company many times during each work day, and they got increasingly frustrated with how the builders handled things. They were slobs with pretty much everything they did, not just the electricity. It's the only times I've ever seen my manager angry! They bothered the customers by making extremely loud noises (and yes, of course there will be noise when a store is rebuilding, but they did NOTHING to lower the volumes, which they apparently easily could've done), their equipment sent out fumes that made people dizzy, they drilled holes in the ceiling that cracked it up so much that debris started falling down (thankfully not on customers) etc, etc. So when a certain - very, VERY angry - customer came to me with a complaint, I was not surprised.

I was standing alone at the register, and my only other colleague that worked that shift was in the back, where the loading dock was. In comes this very tall guy (mind you, I'm also very tall, but this dude was TOWERING over me), his face was almost purple with anger, and he comes up to me. He starts telling the story, of how we - the employees - apparently hadn't checked if the nails had been completely hammered down in the wood, in a hand made speed bump outside the store, that was right nearby the loading dock. In fact, he wondered if they'd even TRIED to hammer them down. He had driven over them with his MANY-WHEELED CARGO TRUCK, and said that if we had punctured his wheels, he would make us pay.

After he had finished yelling, I - very carefully, cause I actually thought he was going to hit me - said that it was not us that had a hand in those things, but rather the builders, who did nothing right. But they had gone for the day. He did not calm down, and I was very scared, so I told him to come with me to the back, where my (male) colleague was, so I'd have a witness if he actually did something. We went to him, and I told him what happened. He said the same thing as me, that the builders were responsible. The guy went away and said something along the lines of ""if I find a puncture, I will have you pay for it!"".

I got back out to the register, and after about an hour, the power cuts off again. The electricity company is called, and they come and try to sort things out. They took an unusually long time to fix it, but I didn't think too much of it since there were no customers there at the time. The power comes back after about 40 minutes, and I start everything up again. Then my colleague comes out from the back, and asks me ""hey, did you hear what happened?!""

Usually, what makes us lose power is when too many machines are connected to the power supply, and sometimes the builders run over cables with their portable elevator, so they pop out of the wall. And since the workers had gone for the day and couldn't have moved anything, I figured that their equipment (still running) had blown a fuse like it usually did, or maybe it had burned out the entire electrical cabinet they had in the room they worked in, cause that would've taken some time to fix. But oh boy, was I wrong!

My colleague goes on to tell me that the angry trucker was the culprit! The dude had snuck up to the side of our store building, AND PULLED OUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF POWER CABLES THAT WERE CONNECTED TO THE FUSE BOXES! I did not believe my ears! The electrician was SO fast to fix it, too, he deserves some kind of award (also, if I remember correctly, it was actually a Saturday, so he wasn't even supposed to come in to work AT ALL!).

I talked to my manager about it all the next day, and she basically said that the trucker was not very smart, cause if his wheels WERE damaged now, he could not win a claim for the money, because he committed a crime! I didn't hear what happened after this, but I think it never got cleared up.

TL;DR The builders MAY have punctured a man's truck wheels, so he punished the completely innocent store/employees by yanking out all hundreds of power cables from the fuse boxes outside the building, so we lost all power for a while."

I’m currently working at a clothing store in one of the local malls. It was my day off, but I got called in because of low staff. It’s Monday, so business is extremely slow as most people are at work or school in the area. 

About an hour into my shift, in walks a burly older dude who starts browsing the men’s section. Now, our store is marketed as “youth street style,” but we have had older customers find some things they like, so I didn’t think much of it. I see him kind of wandering aimlessly, so in the native tongue I greet him and ask if he needs any help. He says he is looking for “____” pants. I ask him to repeat himself because I thought I was misunderstanding. He does. Then I say (in English this time) “Umm sorry would you mind describing these pants in English?” This dude looks at me so disappointingly, and just repeats the word, again, in the native tongue.

Okay, we do get a lot of older people that would rather speak to someone who is fluent, so I walk over to my coworker and ask her. The dude is standing right next to me. I repeat what he said as best as I can, and not even my coworker knows what he means. He never tries to step in and clarify and just keeps his focus on me. 

So, naturally, I turn to him and say “I’m sorry, but I don’t think we do...” He sighs and gives me a hard look of frustration, and in a very condescending tone asks me (in English from here on), “You don’t know what you’re selling?” Politely, I reply, “yes, I do, but it would help me if you could describe it in English, if you don’t mind.” He then hyperactively waves his hands at me, and tells me to follow him, so I do, and he brings me to a table where he POINTS out the pants he’s looking for (uhhh why didn’t he show me to begin with if he knew where they were??). I ask him what size he is usually, and he tells me he’s “105 in the waist.” I pull out the biggest size we carry in those pants, and ask him if he wants to try them. He holds them up and says they’re too small.  Again, he says, “I NEED 105 IN THE WAIST!!!”I proceed to tell him we don’t know the exact measurements of pants, we just have the sizes on the tag to go by. He doesn’t want to listen, waves his hands at me, and tells me never mind. Cool.

Maybe it’s just the fact that it’s a Monday, but almost every customer I have encountered since has been condescending or dismissive in some way EVEN when I’m speaking the native language. How fun! Maybe the universe didn’t want my ass to work today, but I’ll still kill them with my customer service smile :)))"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d4vysw/rude_customer_actually_apologizes/,"Rude customer actually apologizes When I was working at a thrift store, we would get all sorts of customers.  Most are nice folks and some not so much.  I was busy ringing people up and helping people with merchandise they wanted to look at.  I then look up from my work at the cash wrap and spot a guy (we'll call ""Todd"") carrying a crockpot in his arms.  Bear in mind that Todd is a regular.

&#x200B;

For some weird reason, I call Todd over and ask if he paid for it.  He goes off, saying things like ""you know me, I wouldn't steal"" and ""I shop here all the time; do you think I would steal?"" I was kinda shocked that Todd would act or behave this way toward me.  I apologize and my co-worker told me that I was just doing my job (other co-worker vouched for Todd as he had rung him up).  I excuse myself and went to the bathroom to cry as I just felt horrible for pissing him off and for being yelled at for doing my job.  

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few days later, I was at the cash wrap and Todd approaches me and, with true conviction in his eyes, tells me that he wanted to apologize for his behavior and that he behaved inappropriately.  To paraphrase him, he tells me that he's not a rude person in real life.  I accepted his apology and told him that my asking him was just an impulse.  Later that day, I'm in the break room for a swig of water and my supervisor (who's on his lunch break) asks me if Todd apologized.  I said yes and then the supervisor proceeded to tell me that he had shown up the day before, thinking I was working (I was off) to say he was sorry.

&#x200B;

Out of all the rude customers I've had, Todd is only one out of TWO that actually apologized for their crappy behavior and were genuine about it."

Interesting transactions but I'm liking it so far. Instead of one bad customer a shift, now it's one cracked out crazy person a week! So many stories that I'm gonna vent out to you guys..

One day I'm covering a break and cashiering. This man comes up with just a birthday card. 

Me - me

Customer - C

Potato lady - PL

Me: ""Celebrating someone's birthday today?""

C: ""Ha yeah, it's my daughter! Can I also get cash back for her?""

Me: ""of course! As long as my register let's me!""

He pays and ask for $40 while we make more idle chitchat. At the time no one else was in the line. Then two older ladies walk up but they're chatting away at themselves. My register actually refuses his cash back because it was still early in the day and I simply didnt have enough to give out.

Me: ""Oh! I'm sorry, it seems like I dont have enough in my register.""

C: ""Ah that's okay, I already give her enough money as it is aha! So what do I have to do now?""

Before I can reply one of the ladies comes up to him.

PL: ""Excuseeee me! Can you hurry up?! I have potato salad in the car!""

It's literally only been like 30 seconds. 

C: ""Well if SOME people werent so rude I would hurry!

(He stops and stares at her)

"" Well?! Are you going to keep harassing me or are you going to let me pay??""

She clearly has never been called out and is just shrinking behind her friend

C: (turns back to me) ""The nerve of some people! Anyways, you have a great day!""

Me: ""You too sir!""

I was expecting her to complain about him when he was gone but she couldnt stop staring at him and never even responded to me.
All her friend said to PL was ""I'll just..uh see you later.""

My store isnt a grocery store either, I couldnt help but think that if your priority is food then you probably shouldnt be stopping in to buy random household things."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d4wbk3/why_cant_customers_say_excuse_me/,"Why can't customers say ""excuse me""? I work in the meat department at my store, we cut our beef steaks on site (rump, porterhouse etc.) and there's a pretty open view of the shop floor where this happens (there's a refrigerated case between us and the customer, a bit below shoulder height), we can see out and look at the department and customers can see us and talk to us if they need too. 

So, I'm here wrapping steaks today, not really paying much attention to a customer on the other side, I knew he was there though. He's kinda just standing there, so I assume he's looking at the steaks, again, not really paying attention and haven't really looked up to see him staring at me. 
Had been a solid minute of him staring at me and he decides, instead of saying ""excuse me"" to clear his throat, which still didn't get my attention until I look up like 20 seconds later:

Me: Oh hey mate, did you need a hand with anything?

Customer: Do you have any thin beef sausages?""

I try have a look at the shelf as some customers aren't very good at looking and he's like:

""I've already looked""

Me: ""ah ok no worries, I'll see if some came in today""

None came in, bit rough

Me: nah sorry mate, didn't have any come in today. 

Customer: whatever
And then he walked out of the store 

But yeah just a cheeky story of customers refusing to use any sort of manners."

I work sales for a major wireless carrier in the US, and this particular tale happened a few months ago. To be specific, it was the day before my birthday. It was my scheduled day off but I asked to work anyways and take my birthday off.

Shortly after opening the store we get a phone call. The caller ID shows that it's a good friend of mine, so I tell my co-worker that I'll take the call.

>Me: Hey, what's up?

>Friend: Felyne! Thank god it's you. Do you have any USB-C chargers? The one that came with my phone is barely working and my phone is almost dead.

>Me: Yeah I've got some. Want me to set one aside for you?

>Friend: Yes please. I'll be there in like fifteen minutes.

>Me: Gotcha, I'll grab one off the shelf. See you then.

Twenty or so minutes later my friend shows up...with a gift bag.


>Friend: My charger isn't actually broken; I just wanted to make sure you were working. Happy birthday!

Clever. I dig that. Inside the bag was a card, some strawberry cream cheese cupcakes (my favorite) and a Switch game. We chat for a while, and he leaves to run some errands. I bring the bag into the backroom and carry on with my day.

The cupcakes were delicious, by the way.

Tl;dr: Buddy of mine feigns a broken charger to make sure I'm working and stops by with a birthday gift."

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d4rxx4/the_1_dilemma/,"The €1 dilemma So. For the past few months I've been working as a cashier in a supermarket. Now, as most of you know, there can be some really... annoying customers. Here's my fair share of the stories, even if it's not the most horrible thing to happen.

&#x200B;

So, this took place several weeks ago. I was happily going on with my afternoon shift. Then these elderly couple come in and start to put their products on the counter and I scan them, as I'm supposed to. They were really nice at the start and there were was really nothing to criticize them on... Until the moment of paying comes. NOTE: I did make an accident during the events, but the way they handled it wasn't the best.

  
Before I continue, here's a little background: While in most stores, you can pay a little bit extra with your card, and then the cashier hands you the extra money in cash. (So you kind of withdraw the money from your bank account) However, our store does not accept this method, since we literally have an ATM in the corner.

&#x200B;

So... EC = Elderly Couple. ME = Me.

EC: ""Can we do a small withdrawal at your cash register?""  
ME: ""I'm sorry ma'am, but we don't do that here. There is an ATM over there where you can withdraw some money."" (I pointed them in the direction and generally stayed nice to them.)  
EC: ""We know, but you can only withdraw €20 or more. And we only need €1.""  


Since they were super nice up until this moment, I decided to be a good guy and accept their request. However, since this was something I had never done before AND because it's something out of the ordinary (and because I can't cope with sudden changes that well), I got a little confused and instead, accidently charged €1 too much. I didn't realize it at first and neither did they, so I went on with the next customer. This is where stuff goes down.

&#x200B;

As I was busy with the next customer, they came back to me.

EC: ""I'm sorry, but you have charged €1 too much.""  
ME: ""Oh, I did? I apologize. Once I am done with this customer, I can help you further, okay?""

They shrugged it off at first. (NOTE: There was quite a line building up) But within in a minute they became impatient and started to get mad at me

EC: ""WE DEMAND THAT €1 BACK!""

At this point, I was still convinced that I hadn't screwed up, so I calmly explained my actions and how they would be correctly. They kept demanding the €1 (which was in the right of them), so I kindly gave them the €1 back, and they left kind of fed up. (The discussion kinda went back and forth for a while, as I tried to stay calm, not get a panic attack and not to cry, as they kept being mad and yelling at me)

&#x200B;

The next customer was really nice and gave me an extra €1 with his products, however, which was really nice.

&#x200B;

In the end, I did make the mistake. But is it that bad? We cashiers are human and we make mistakes. I was and always am in the position to help people. However, whenever they get mad at me, I am less likely to cooperate, as a way of karma. Had they stayed calm and waited patiently, so they could calmly explain what I did wrong, I would probably realize my mistake sooner and be more willing to help them.

&#x200B;

If you have discovered a mistake the cashier has made, please point it out nicely and respect that they have more customers to help."

Anyways some backstory,  I've been touring with my band for the last 6 month and just got back about a month ago. So I was thinking that I need a job to pass the time. I ended up getting a job at a car wash. Im 20 years old and was born with a heart condition (this will be important later) This happened a Wednesday (also important) on to the story. TL:DR at the bottom.

Cast:

Op- Me

CS- Cool Supervisor (Dave)

CL-Crazy Lady (Karen)

FM- Friend Minor (Noel)

CM- Camaro Lady (Margaret)

So about a month into this job  I've gotten pretty comfortable working I know just about everyone there and I quickly realise that Senior Day (Wednesday) is the worst day of the week. The way my  shift goes is open till the minors come, we have a lot. Well one of these minors (FM) came early and I happen to be friends with him so Dave put me and him on the same team. My job was to clean the inside of the car his was to clean side 2, the Noel was stuck on a lady with a Camaro (Margaret) so I just move on to the next car. I finish doing every thing I needed to so I gather my things to get out and Karen ask for my supervisor (Dave), this super common since people are really picky about their cars. I go get him and I have to stay just incase Karen needs me to wipe/clean anything off. Karen then ""politely"" accuses Noel of smoking in her car, the legal smoking age where I live is 18 and he had just turned 17 in June and was still in HS. Dave tried to explain this but she was adamant. Something I should add is that he was still with Margaret. Karen then asked who was inside the car I confess it was me (wrong thing to do) Karenthen switches the blame to me and accuses me of smoking in her car saying things like ""check his pockets hes going to have a vape"" or ""check the cameras youll see"". Im one of three people who don't smoke Dave tried to explain to her that I don't smoke. I then say that I can't smoke cause I have a heart condition thats doesn't let me smoke (not that i want to). Still adament she keeps waiving our explaining and clearly reasoning with here was impossible so she just asked if she could have some frangrance so it doesn't smell like ""smoke"". As she was leaving she said something that I find funny even now ""Just remember people are watching"" we both looked at eachother and laughed internally. We got her a  fragrance and sent her on her way. I ended by taking the only smoke I've ever took but since I dont smoke I just ate a sandwich.

TL:DR- A Karen accuses a minor and someone with a heart condition of smoking in her car.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d46whu/stop_calling_it_by_its_name/,"""Stop calling it by its name!"" I work in the electronics section of my local location of a popular department store. The town is largely populated by old/retired people, so I'm used to explaining technology in a simple-to-understand way. With that out of the way, on to the story.

I'm stocking shelves when I see an older man staring at cables and muttering to himself. I put on a smile, walk over, and do my whole ""hello, welcome to [store], how may I help you"" thing.

Man: ""I'm so sick and tired of needing so many cables to connect my technology. I have an iPad, a phone, and a computer and it's a pain to connect it all.""

Me: ""I completely understand sir, what kind of cabl-""

Him: ""I have a [camera] and I want to connect it with my computer.""

Me: ""Oh, okay! No problem, sir, those kinds of cables are right over here.""

Now, we have the USB-C and Micro-USB cables mixed in with each other, so I figure I should let him know which is which. I've done the same thing with plenty of other people and they were more than capable of figuring it out.

Me: ""So, make sure when you're selecting your cable, it ha-""

Him: ""These are too expensive.""

Me: ""Well, sir, this is the cheapest that these cables usually go for. Now, when you're selecting a cable, make sure it says 'micro-USB' on the box, like thi-""

Him: ""I don't understand.""

Me: ""Well, sir, some of these are what are known as Micro-USB, which is what fits your camera. Some of these are USB-C, whi-""

Him: ""What are you saying?!""

Me: ""I understand the confusion, sir, the names are simila-""

Him: ""No, I don't understand your terminology!""

Me: ""Sir, I understand, but that's what I'm trying to expla-""

Him: ""Clearly you don't understand people,"" I'm a terrible worker, I'm out of touch, etc.

At this point, I realize he's going to refuse any kind of help, so I decide to take our cheapest cable, peel off the tape keeping it shut, and show him the end. He yanks the cable out of my hand as I'm in the middle of saying ""Is this what you're looking  for"" and starts walking towards the exit, and I chase after him, explaining that he needs the box in order to check out. He barks that he doesn't need it, finally grabbing it out of my hand when I restate that he needs a barcode if he intends to pay for it. He barks something about ""teaching me how to work"" as I sigh and go back to stocking boxes."

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d495r3/guy_gets_stuck_in_a_loop_about_backpacks/,"Guy gets stuck in a loop about backpacks Hey retail people, this is my first post on the sub. I’m on mobile and not that great of a writer so apologies in advance. This happened about a week ago. It’s a long one...

I’m a manger at an office supplies chain store. I’d say 85% of our customers are easy but oh man that 15%. Right now, we are at the end of back to school season so there’s a lot clearance going on. This tends to incur the wrath of a lot of penny pinchers and more Karens than usual. This story is about one of those people. Sadly I was on the phone with our general manager (we have 4 mangers total for various departments) so I didn’t get to handle this personally but I watched it all happen and got a full recap. 

Our characters today are-
Plaid Lad- PL
Coworker- CO
Manger 1- M1
Manger 2- M2

Right now we have a sale that is 50% off school backpacks. We carry backpacks all year round but during back to school we get an entire new rack and shipment for kids. Think like ages 5-17. These backpacks are OBVIOUS. As in directly up front in the middle of the store obvious. They have a dedicated sign and every one has a sticker marking it as 50% off. All year backpacks are in an aisle closer to the back of the store. These are classified as business cases because they hang out with the briefcases and are insanely expensive and made with “better materials”. Cue this early 30’s gentleman coming in with a plaid shirt and a trilby on.

PL: Hey where would I find backpacks?

CO: (standing directly in front of the rack) We have a few up front here on sale, but there is more back in x aisle. 

PL: Okay thanks. (proceeds to check out the rack and then head back to the aisle)

 This is when I take a phone call from the GM about a scheduling crisis so I head to an inconspicuous spot.
CO has gone to the register to check someone out and M1 takes his place near the doors. This is when I notice PL is back up front holding a backpack from the aisle and is taking pictures on his phone of the signs on the school backpacks. Weird, but okay, after that he heads up to the register. I’m told the interaction went like this (paraphrasing) all while PL is sweating and stuttering:  

PL: So...this is a backpack s-so it’ll be 50% off right?

CO: Unfortunately the sale is only for the school backpacks up front there. You have one that is classified as a business case so it’s not on sale. I’m sorry. 

PL: But it’s a backpack. It should be on sale. The sign says ALL BACKPACKS. 

CO: It’s specifically for all school backpacks, I’m sorry if it’s confusing, but the 50% off ones have stickers on them. 

PL: Thats completely ridiculous. I want to speak to a manager. 

M1 is called over to help, he is generally chill and he doesn’t give in to customers acting a fool. 

M1: What can I do for you?

PL: Your sign says ALL BACKPACKS (it doesn’t) and this is a backpack. (Just for reference he has a messenger bag actually) 

M1: Yeah our 50% off sale is actually for the school backpacks it’s— 

PL: But I’m using this for school. So why does it matter. It should be 50% off. That’s what the sign says. 

M1: I’m sorry but there’s not a lot I can do about it I could maybe see if we have a coupon and I can—

PL: What’s the corporate number? I’m gonna call them about this.

For general ease of use for employees and customers we have business cards printed out with the corporate numbers on them because there’s a few different ones for different things (general, rewards program, etc.) 

M1: (hands him a card) The general number is the customer service line. 

PL: Wow you guys are such a bad store you have cards already made?? (Storms out after asking CO for M1’s name and like all of us, he’s clearly wearing a name tag)

Okay well annoying but situation handled right? Nah. Maybe 2 minutes pass and dude comes back. Heading in the exit door, CO confronts him. 

CO: Was there something else we could do for yo—

PL: Yeah IM PISSED OFF.  (Becoming more animated) This is garbage. It said all packs. 

CO: Well sir it— 

He storms off to M1 who is helping another customer with a computer. PL marches up to him, and M1 radios for me or M2 so he can finish with his customer. I am still on the phone at this point trying to help GM figure out the schedule for next week but M2 just happened to be walking by already. 

He flags him down and the whole bit starts again. 
As they walk past me to the rack of school backpacks I hear PL’s phone camera once again going off all over the place. 

M2: So on this sign here, as you can see, it does say “excludes business cases and x brand” 

PL: I’m using this for SCHOOL. So I should get the discount. It said aLL bAcKPaCkS. 

M2: Yes, and I’m sorry sir but the one that you have- PL: You have to be kidding me. Are you dumb? Come back and show me the difference then! 


They walk back to the aisle and I can only imagine that he just keeps talking in circles. 

I didn’t see the resolution but after I got off the phone CO told me that M2 gave him the 50% off just to get the guy to leave. 

I have mixed feelings on that, usually I’m the type of manager to just get rude/mean customers out of my associates faces but 50% cuts deep for us cause we’re a smaller store compared to other locations in the area. M2 has only been a manager for a month or so, so I could see where he’s coming from but also I know CO and M1 felt a bit betrayed. They spent the time trying to find solutions and telling this rude guy no just for him to get what he wanted anyway by being such a nuisance. 
We all came to the conclusion that at some point he decided he wanted to start a fight about this, between the pictures/being nervous and sweaty at first it just seemed too weird. 

Im curious if any of you would have handled it differently, let me know. 
Thanks for reading, Take care out there everyone!

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d41b5c/you_measured_his_foot_wrong/,"""you measured his foot wrong!"" So for context I work at a shoe store. This lady comes in with three boys, one is probably 9 or so, and the other two are probably 5 or around that. I ask her for their shoe size so I can show her what shoes are available in their sizes. She then tells me that she doesn't know the oldest kid's size so I ask to measure his foot and she agrees. He came out to be about a 11 (in youth sizes), I always tell the parents what size their kids wear just so they can know. When i told her she began to raise her voice ""no! He does not wear an 11 that's way too big he probably wears an 12 or so. You measured his foot wrong!"" (yes she said he wears a size bigger AFTER saying an 11 was too big). My manager quickly saw the situation arising and she came over, and asked if she could measure his foot. She measured his foot and it came out to be an 12 (I do make mistakes sometimes as i am new). I went back and got the shoes for all three of her kids. She got all three of her kids matching shoes and had two of them trying them on at once while the youngest was eating some lego brick candy and dropping it on the floor. During that time she was making side comments like ""I have to re-lace the shoes because YOU did it wrong."" Thankfully my manager was helping me as it would've taken forever on my own. The bright side of dealing with this was that she got three pairs of shoes and it helped me make my daily sales goal so it was cool. In the end please be nice to retail workers as we literally do this every day and it really sucks to be treated like crap at work."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d3qo65/your_id_is_bright_pink/,"Your ID is... bright pink? At work, I keep bright pink sticky notes with me. I doodle, keep notes, and honestly just fiddle with them to keep calm during our favorite problem-customers-meltdowns.

Today, I was helping a gentleman with a purchase that required showing his ID. I had already set the ID back down in front of him on the counter. The purchase was made, yet he kept staring down at me. 

""I need my ID."" he says, staring at my hands. In my hands were my clearly bright -pink- sticky notes. At first I was very confused and said,

""Yes sir, its right there."" and nodded down at his ID. He didn't look down. His eyes clearly darted from my notes to my eyes.

""I see you holding it."" he says.

Now, this customer had already been rude earlier. I was already at the level of ""done with you"". I looked from my brightly covered paper in my hands, up at him, back to my paper, back to him.

""Sir. Your ID is right down there if you look-""

""I -SEEEEEEE- it in your hands"" he spits, putting emphasis on the word see. He was trying to mock me. But how do you feel mocked when you know they're 100% wrong?

I finally point as well, right at his ID . The one right in front of him. The one NOT in my hand. The one that is clearly not bright pink.

""Oh. there it is."" and he just grabs it and leaves. No 'I'm sorry', no 'oh I was confused', nothing."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d3ydms/how_a_grocery_store_opens_for_business_complex/,"How a grocery store opens for business: Complex setup methods finally explained Have you ever walked into your local grocery store and suddenly noticed how some of the fresh products (such as fruit, vegetables, meat cuts, fish fillets, and bread) are not in the same spot as they were only days before? How some fresh product is even missing or different than when your last grocery trip? Even more shockingly, sometimes the fresh product might not *even be there at all* if you walk into the store 4 seconds after you watch an employee unlock the door that you've been impatiently pacing in-front of despite operational hours being very clearly posted for you! How does this happen, you ask. I am about to reveal the mystery that is 'Opening for Daily Business'.

First, the employees arrive in the morning, most likely 15 minutes prior to opening despite the opening procedures taking a solid 40 minutes. This is because hours need to be cut so the grocery store can maximize profits. Once the employees have signed in, they begin a very rushed set up of their respective departments. Believe it or not, grocery stores strive to ensure all of the products are fresh, clean and properly stored! A lot of the fresh product you see is actually taken down at night, the surfaces and display plates that it is stored on are cleaned and then it is set up again in the morning. Wow! What a concept!

Here is an example of a **real** conversation that **really** occurred, as two different customers enquirer about these very procedures only minutes after the doors have opened. Let's see what happens.

&#x200B;

Customer 1: \*walks up to the seafood service case where only 2 kinds of fish have been set up so far\* Yes, hello. Could I get a piece of that salmon?

Employee: Good morning. Sorry, but I am still setting this case up so not all of the product is properly tagged yet. What you're looking at is actually trout. 

Customer 1:  . . . . this isn't salmon?

Employee: No miss, it's trout.

\*Customer 2 has now walked up and stands next to Customer 1\*

Customer 1: . . . . but the tag above it says it's 'salmon'.

Employee: Right, I understand. However, as I said earlier, I am still setting everything up.

Customer 1: Well I need salmon. \*Customer 2 meanwhile,  is patiently waiting to be served next.\*

Employee: We do have some salmon fillets already pre-packaged, just behind you on the shelves. It's the same salmon I'd be putting in this case. I just haven't gotten to it yet.

Customer 1: Oh. You're tags are wrong then because it says 'salmon' above this trout. \*Walks away to grab the pre-packaged salmon.\*

Customer 2: \*steps up\*  Yes, hello. Could I get a piece of this organic salmon?

Employee: . . . . It is not salmon, miss. Sorry, but I am still setting up so not all of the product is properly tagged yet. What you're looking at is actually trout. 

Customer 2: Oh. So it's not organic salmon?

Employee: . . . . . . .

Please, to avoid causing violent insanity for your grocery store employees, remember that they need to set up a lot of the fresh product you see every day and it takes time.

And this concludes this segment on 'Opening for Daily Business'."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d3o32l/shes_a_darling/,"‘She’s a darling’ I just finished my last shift temping for an accessories store and was reminded of this story.

This store sold belts, and an old lady comes in asking for one. She walks quite slowly, has a tube in her nose and is dragging what looks like an oxygen tank behind her.

I directed her to the belts, and she explains that she’s lost weight recently and needs a belt. All good. She finds one and holds it out to me, along with the money for it.

Our till is across the store, and I tell her so. It’s a pretty small shop but she looks hesitant. So I told her not to worry and just rang it up myself and brought the belt back to her.

She thanks me profusely, I say no problem, then she asks my name. I tell her and she says ‘L, you’re a darling’. Then she indicates my supervisor who is behind the till and asks if that’s my manager. I say yes. 

This old ill lady slowly makes her way to my supervisor and lets her know that I was kind, really helpful etc etc. I could hear this (it’s a very small store) and I fully teared up. Absolutely the best customer I had the whole time I was there."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d3i53y/a_coworker_saved_a_life_today/,"A coworker saved a life today I work at a grocery store. Today, an employee in the meat department collapsed at 7am, right after the store opened. Someone working next to him flipped him over onto his back and started yelling his name and for help. He was unconscious, not breathing, and turning purple. 

Someone from my team saw and immediately called 911 while he ran over to our coworker on the floor. He began doing CPR on him and didn’t stop until the EMTs arrived (4 minutes). The manager on duty ran over with the defibrillator right as the paramedics got there. They cut his shirt open and I saw him laying there, not breathing or moving, as they shoved tubes down his throat and began to push air into his lungs. 

Meanwhile, a customer was asking me to serve her a pint of sweet potatoes, completely oblivious to the man basically dead on the floor ten feet away. 

He was rushed into emergency surgery and they think he had an aneurysm. We still don’t know how he is doing. But I do know that the guy who rushed to call 911 and do CPR saved his life. I can’t imagine what he must have been feeling at the time or how he is feeling now. 

I want to raise enough money from the staff to get him two tickets to a game of his favorite football team, but it’s the least that I can do. The bravery and compassion that he showed today is unreal. 

I hope that lady enjoys her sweet potatoes...


***UPDATE***

The guy that had the aneurysm came out of his surgery in a coma. They’re expecting him to come out of it soon and begin rehabilitation but from the sounds of it, his life is forever changed.

*** UPDATE 2 ***
He passed away a few days ago. Work has set up counseling for anyone needing it and made sure that the helping employee was well taken care of. It’s been a surreal, brutal, terrible couple of weeks. My heart is so heavy for his family."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d3md4t/customer_accused_me_of_theft_today/,"Customer accused me of theft today I'm a volunteer in Australia. I volunteer in an opportunity shop (op shop) and I am still really upset with this rude, ungrateful customer I had the displeasure of dealing with.

This customer had one of those cases that you put all your cards in so you can flip through them easier (see here: [case](https://www.wish.com/product/5a508939cd0e680915c27bab?from_ad=goog_shopping&_display_country_code=AU&_force_currency_code=AUD&pid=googleadwords_int&c=%7BcampaignId%7D&ad_cid=5a508939cd0e680915c27bab&ad_cc=AU&ad_curr=AUD&ad_price=3.00&fallback_cids=5c0f73133a5a2b6b4a947ad65b0278a227428779865f917b5ba37f7eded3583cad8cae595b1104366b11c815ee46b4425c3982e3329d6c234170e51f5c8096e31aae9a415ba7deb8&campaign_id=6465790720&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIp9izprPN5AIVl6mWCh1z7QW9EAkYByABEgKJNvD_BwE&hide_login_modal=true)). She dropped it where we keep the CDs.

I found it when I was tidying the area and gave it back to her. She thanked me, put it in her handbag and all was good. I went back to my job and she went back to browsing.

Another volunteer ( I shall refer to as Jim for clarity) was serving her at the counter when she was trying to pay for her items but couldn't find her bank card.

She asked me where I found it because her card was missing. I naturally assume it fell out somewhere near the CDs and tried looking for it there. Jim helped me search for it but we couldn't find it anywhere in the area.

She then has the nerve to accuse me of taking her card because I was the one found her case and returned it to her.

She wouldn't let me leave her sight so I had Jim go out the back and get the manager so we could sort out this issue.

Manager comes out, we explain the situation and he offers to help look for the card, and offers to get her name and number so we can contact her if we find it. Customer says that isn't good enough and wants him to search me and turn out my pockets. He rightly denies that request and she demands him to call the police which he also refuses to do.

Customer says she is going to make a formal complaint and leaves to get money out of the bank and cancel her card.

Manager sends me out the back to have a small break and make sure I'm OK.

Apparently she came back and paid for her things but I was still on my break.

Manager had to call the regional manager and explain the whole situation to her so she would have a heads up in case a complaint really did come through.

A bunch of us were making fun of her when she left and saying she probably left it at home or in her car. Manager certainly wasn't going to waste any effort in looking for the card after she accused one of his volunteers of stealing it.

TLDR: Ungrateful customer says I stole her bank card because she dropped something and I happened to return it to her."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d3qxqc/dumbass_on_the_glass/,"Dumbass on the Glass So, as I've mentioned on a post in r/idontworkherelady, I work at a car dealership. It's a pretty great job, too. Decent pay, a lax work schedule, and the rest of the staff is great.

You see, the way the building is designed, the different offices are in the back of the showroom where we keep the Corvettes, behind glass doors and glass walls. I clean the doors at least once every other day, but apparently, I'm too good at my job because people are always walking into the glass.

In particular, when people are getting ready to leave my office, they somehow completely miss the door and leave a picture-perfect faceprint 2 feet to the left, which I then have to clean up later. What's even worse is that we always leave the office door open, so none of these people were smashing into the door. These people always manage to completely miss the door and hit the glass like a bird against a windowpane. There is literally no excuse for this level of stupidity.

This isn't a once-in-a-blue-moon incident, either. I've counted at least 10 cases of people hitting the glass on that one wall, and I've only been working here for a few months. And before you ask, I was one of those 10 cases, too.

It's actually amazing that the glass hasn't cracked yet. It's become such a common issue that we've considered putting a sticker on the wall, or putting an advertisement display in front of it to steer people away from it. We've tried the latter, and it actually worked for a month, but then we removed the display later.

Just a week and a half ago, a customer was walking out the office (interfacing with the customers isn't really a part of my job yet, so I don't pay much attention to these meetings), and left the most perfect faceprint I have ever seen. We patiently waited for her to get out of earshot, before promptly laughing our asses off at the fact that it FINALLY happened again.

The best part was that my supervisor asked me to go polish the glass afterwards. She is fucking awesome."

I work at this store in Norway that sells curtains, towels, pillows stuff like that

But this happened at least an hour or so ago. I was just doing my thing, Manning the cash register. 

Btw, we have two different stores in my town, they’re both pretty small so we only need one person on at the time, so I’m alone until I leave today. 

Anyway, this woman came in asking about pleated curtains. Not sure if that’s what they’re called in English, but I’m just gonna call it that, because that’s what google translate said.
She wanted one that went from her ceiling to her floor, because her window was that tall. (I’m terrible at explaining, I’m sorry)

I told her we didn’t have any in those measurements, and that if she wanted we could order some, but they would have to be custom made and that it was a whole process. I added that I was still pretty new, and didn’t really know much about that. But the lady insisted I check the price. I just said okay, asked her to wait a moment while I called the other store for some help.
After a minute I found the site I needed, and a folder so we could look at the different fabrics she could get the curtains in.

When I presented the folder to her, she just told me she wanted it white, and to give her the cheapest option. 
It’s not cheap to get them custom made. And it’s not the fabric that decides the price, I think. I believe it’s actually the measurements. And if she wanted it from roof to floor, it would be pretty expensive anyway. She wouldn’t like the price even if it was 30% off.

I told her that it was the measurements that mostly decided the price, she nodded and I asked her how wide they needed to be, and how tall. I need exact measurements so I can get it right. If she had ordered them there and then, and I got the measurements wrong, I would have some trouble. And I don’t know if she could return them.

Instead of being helpful, she pretty much expected me to know how tall her wall was. 
Listen lady... I’m 20. I took media classes in school. I failed math, I half asses all classes that involved building. I know nothing about houses other than the fact that we live in them.

I told her again that I needed the exact measurements, but this time, she guessed it was 2 meters. Uh... okay. That helps a lot...
Then she proceeded to tell me she didn’t have time to stand here for much longer, left me her number and walked away. 

I still don’t know how to help her. I don’t know how tall her window is, but what I do know, is that I’m too tired for this.


Edit: Forgot to mention that the customer needs to have time when asking about stuff like this"

After about five minutes, she comes over and impatiently taps her foot behind the line up of people checking their lotto tickets. I finally get to her.

Her: No. OBITUARIES. I’m looking for obituaries.

Me: Yes, to my knowledge those are printed in the paper, online, or available at the funeral home/funeral. No one _sells_ obituaries. You were looking at cards.. did you mean sympathy cards? 

Her: No, I mean obituaries. What kind of place is this? It’s not that hard to understand. I’m looking for obituaries.

Me: Well I have no idea how to help you there..

Her: Alright. I am going to a funeral. I want to bring the family an obituary.

Me: I think you’re looking for a sympathy card.

Her: I AM LOOKING FOR AN OBITUARY.

Me: Why, and better yet, how, would we ever sell someone’s obituary here?

Her: This is ridiculous. You’re being stupid. This is stupid. I’ll just go elsewhere.

And with that, she stormed out. 


So like.. obituaries are the little write ups made about people right after they die, right? Does “obituary” mean something else?"

M: if your looking for ***** we have been closed for around a year. 

Ap: so how the hell do i get this thing fixed then it’s still under warranty do I bring it to your house. 

M: the company has been closed for over a year there are no machines still under warranty. 

Ap: the guy I bought it from said he bought it off you 2 weeks and it’s still under warranty that’s the only reason why I bought it off him. Maybe if you did your job properly you would still be in business. 

M: first i have been closed for over a year i have not sold anything in over a year. Second if your not the one that bought q game from me you would have no warranty anyway. Maybe you should have asked whoever you got it from why they were selling a broken machine when they could get it fixed for free and sell it for more. Third you do know me or why i closed I actually take a lot of pride in my work. I actually closed because one of my frequent customers offered me a full time job making over double what i made running the shop.

Ap after a short pause: im sorry i just want to get this thing fixed i have the guy $600 for it is there anything you can do to help. 

M: what kind of game is it and what is it doing. 

Ap: its a cds(a type of old slot machine) and it lights up but nothing else happens.

So I explain that she needs to get back on the highway and head North, to which she immediately interrupts me to tell me she needs to go South. 

I ask her if shes sure she wants this specific store, and she confirms we're talking about the same store. So, I Google it for her and show her she's mistaken and she starts laughing and telling me I have no idea what I'm talking about.

So she shows me her Map quest directions, and I realize that she put them in backwards from store to her house and thats why she thinks she needs to go South. I point that out and she gets mad saying I'm wasting her time, but for whatever reason won't leave until I help her. 

So I decide reasoning with her is not working so I give her the same driections without using the words north or south, and she keeps interrupting me because map quest didn't mention those street names and highways.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d32irq/homeless_guy_doesnt_want_me_to_talk_to_him/,"Homeless Guy Doesn't Want Me To Talk To Him So, I work as a bagger/cart pusher at an organic grocery store. Like any grocery store we have homeless people who will occasionally walk around the parking lot and ask people for change or just hang out in the front. Some of my coworkers and managers will tell them to leave the property or not to harass the customers, but I choose to leave them be mainly because I don't personally care if they ask people for change. Even when a customer asks me to tell them to leave, most of the time I don't do it. 

So there's this homeless man who I'll call Karl who never asks anyone for change, but he'll just hang out in front of the store. We have a sidewalk like path that goes from the front of the store and snakes around to the left side of the store. Karl and another homeless man who I'll call Daniel were sitting on the curb smoking cigarettes. I was looking for carts, and I had to walk behind them to check the left side of the lot. By this time Karl knows I won't bother him.

I walk past them and saw that there were not carts, so I turned to walk back. Daniel chose this time to talk to me.

DANIEL: Hey. (I look over at him with expecting eyes) Don't talk to me.

ME: Alright.

DANIEL: Don't try anything.

ME: Okay.

KARL: You're an idiot, Daniel.

At this point I was walking behind them.

DANIEL: What are you walking behind me for?

ME: Just looking for carts.

At this point I had made my way past them and was walking toward one of the cart corrals to get the carts that were inside, but I could still hear Karl and Daniel talking.

KARL: Just shut up Daniel.

DANIEL: F\*\*K you.

KARL: You know what, just get out of here.

I reached the cart corral and had got the carts out, and when I turned around and started to push the carts back toward the front of the store I saw Daniel walking away. Karl was still sat on the curb smoking his cigarette."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d2qud7/we_all_know_the_music_is_repetitive_but_its_not/,"We all know the music is repetitive, but it's not supposed to be at full-blown Cantina Band level. For the past decade, I've worked in women's fashion retail. This story is from a couple of years ago, when I was a full-time assistant manager at a store in the mall. We had a staff of about a dozen people at any given time.  

My store had one of those music systems where new songs and playlists are automatically pushed to the hard drive every month. Corporate tended to keep the playlists pretty static, however, only tossing a few new songs in here and there. It was pretty standard retail pop music, and it all kind of blended together over the months and years.  

Is it any wonder we barely noticed when the playlist started to dwindle? The computer was deleting songs by its schedule, but not receiving any new downloads. Normally, we'd hear the same songs every day, but only once. We caught on when we started to hear the same songs multiple times. HelpDesk was in no hurry to do their job. We watched (listened?) helplessly as the selection narrowed more and more over the next few weeks, until it was down to about a dozen songs on repeat.  

One morning, I went in with my sales associate to open the store. It was one of the last few days before Labor Day Weekend. I turned on the music when it was time to open the doors, and ""Elastic Heart"" by Sia was playing. Neither of us really made a note of that... at first. That song ended, and the next song began.  

>""... hey, didn't we just hear this song?"" my associate asked.   
>""What? Uh... did we?"" I responded, honestly uncertain, and distracted by morning paperwork.  
>""I'm pretty sure we did,"" she said.  
>""Well, maybe it's the end of the playlist, and it just happened to restart the shuffle with the same song,"" I suggested. She agreed that might be it.   

But in our (elastic) hearts... we felt a deep sense of dread. And our fears were confirmed when the song proceeded to play a third time in a row. We laughed, since that's about all we could do, especially since HelpDesk was ""aware of the problem"" already. I wanted to just turn it off, but my associates couldn't handle the quiet.  

Over the first three days, Elastic Heart would've played approximately 453 times during open hours. I, personally, would've heard it 280 times over my three shifts (not counting my breaks, or non-open hours). Even if I were only subjected to five hours of music per shift, (which would be a conservative estimate, especially since the holiday weekend meant everyone was almost always on the sales floor), I still would've heard it about 200 times in 72 hours.  

Sure, we laughed at the absurdity, and we had the comedy of watching customer reactions as they tried to remember whether or not they had just heard the same song. Still, combined with the stress of the holiday weekend, tempers started to fray. Even the customers were more irritable, and they only had to hear the song a handful of times. I've often wondered about the deleterious psychological effects of involuntarily hearing the same few songs on a loop. Hearing just the one song, over and over, for hours and days on end... well, that takes it from brainwashing to downright torture. The humorous aspects soon withered, and I felt like we were lab rats being experimented upon.  

I couldn't take it anymore, and refused to turn it on by the fourth day, no matter what the part-timers said. To add to the nonsense, the music system didn't have any standard jacks or plugs, so we couldn't just hook our phones up and play something else over the stereo. We ended up bringing in our own Bluetooth speakers and using our personal data plans to stream music (because, of course, the store did not have wifi).  

Fixing it was a huge PITA and involved a lot of phone tag when I could get time away from the sales floor, but I eventually emerged victorious.  

... that is, until the following year, when it happened AGAIN. With the SAME SONG. I think I still have a twitch whenever I hear it.  

TL;DR: Over Labor Day Weekend, the store's music system deleted all the songs off its hard drive except ""Elastic Heart"" by Sia, and the associates insisted on keeping the stereo on. We lasted three days before taking matters into our own hands."

Guy: ""Hey, your vending machine isn't working. It ate my money.""

*(I think he means the machine three buildings over)*

Me: ""I'm so sorry that happened, but sadly those aren't our machines.""

G: ""Yeah, but I need my money back. Can't you just give me a refund? It's like a dollar.""

M: ""I can't do that. Like I said those machines are owned by a different company and I have no way to refund you. You can try calling the 800 number on the machine and speak with them.""

G: ""*sigh* But I don't wanna deal with all that. I have class soon. Is it that hard to just give my money back?""

M: ""I don't think you understand, Sir. We cannot help you. We do not get any revinue from those machines because we. do. not. own. them. or. their. products. How can we give you money we just don't have?""

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d2qn3l/online_mistakes/,"Online mistakes I was reading a story earlier which reminded me about this experience from about 7 years ago. I used to work in the complaints team for a large, reputable department store in the UK. Being in the complaints team, I would usually only see complaints from customers whose issues could not or had not been fixed by the Customer Services departments. We were well respected within the organisation, as every member of the team had a lot of Customer Services experience and had time and authority to resolve almost any problem. Complaints sent to the Managing Director  and other executives within the company would be sent to my team to deal with.
 
One time I received a call from the Customer Services department. A customer was on the line complaining that we'd gotten his online order wrong. The customer had ordered some kind of face cream, listed as 6x30ml pots of face cream, costing in the region of £400 (I forget the exact amount). He had called a couple of days earlierto say he had received the order and received 6x5ml pots. The call handler at that point replaced his order and wrote off the pots he initially received, meaning that the customer could keep them, free of charge. The customer had received the replacement product but it was the same thing; 5ml pots instead of 30ml pots. The customer was furious and the Customer Service rep transferred him over to me.
 
After about 5 minutes of shouting about how incompetent our company were (these 5 minutes were the best part of any call - I would never need to pay attention and could let my mind wander as I'd heard it all a million times), I told the customer I would make some enquiries and call him back. I contacted the buyer for this product and learned that it was incorrectly listed on the web. It was 6x 5mls, or 30mls total; not 6x30mls. What he received was correct, and the buyer immediately went away to correct the website.
 
I called the customer back and explained that there is a problem on the website and we are correcting it now. However the products he has been sent is correct and we do not have the product he thought he ordered. I explained that he has two options: Keep what he has been sent at the price he paid for it (essentially a buy one get one free offer) or send it all back and receive a full refund plus £50 cash (not a gift card) as an apology for the mistake.
 
The customer refused both of my offers (cue another, longer rant, and me sitting back to enjoy a further 10 minutes of not having to do anything) and said he wants what he ordered. C (customer)- ""You HAVE to honour the contract! It's the law"".
 
Me- ""No sir. We don't have that product in stock. We can't send it to you. It has been corrected on the website now - look."" And, sure enough, the website had been fixed already and the correct volume was shown. ""If you send us the products back I'll give you a full refund and transfer £50.00 into your bank account by way of apology. The postage is 100% free or I can even send a courier to pick them up from you tomorrow morning to save you the hassle.""
 
C- ""I can't send them back. I've given them away to friends who've already used them.""
 
Me- ""Well in that case, feel free to keep the 6 pots sent to you originally. You're quite right, we did tell you days ago to keep them. Send us the other 6 back which you just received an hour ago, and I'll give you a full refund. Or, you can keep all of them at the price you've paid, and I'll still send you £50.00 as an apology for the mix-up.""
 
C- ""No, you need to send me the amount of cream I ordered.""
 
I quickly worked out that what he was asking me for was £2400 worth of product for only £400. This was beyone the remit of even my team. I spoke to my manager and explained the situation. We both felt that the customer knew that he wouldnt be getting 6x30ml pots before he placed the order but that he was trying his luck to take advantage of the error. It was probable that he had sold them on Ebay rather than giving them to friends. Even if it had been an honest mistake, which we had to assume it was, I was offering the customer to keep £400 worth of products absolutely free. And still, this wasn't good enough. After a few minutes, we decided that we would refund him the full purchase price of his order and allow him to keep everything that he had received.
 
Was the customer content with this? Of course not. C-""YOU HAVE TO SEND ME THE AMOUNT OF CREAM I ORDERED!""
 
I told the customer that was his only option. Processed the the refund there and then and told the customer our address to write a complaint if he wanted to take it up further. He did. Two days later I got an email from the Managing Director with the letter from this customer attached. He asked me to respond to the customer on his behalf, and told me that he felt the offer made had been fair. I gleefully wrote to the customer, enclosing a copy of the MD's email to me, explaining that the offer he had been given was fair and reasonable and that there would be no further discussion on the matter. I never heard from the customer again after that."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d2k9lt/whole_family_comes_to_shoplift_not_once_not_twice/,"Whole family comes to shoplift not once... not twice... but THREE times. This is another story from my time working at a store going through liquidation during the summer of 2019.

Around when I had first started, I became grossly aware about how bad of a problem shoplifting actually was in retail, or at least at my job. 

The first time this family came in we were able to scare them away. While we couldn’t really do anything to stop shoplifters if we saw them (most we could do was yell and hope to embarrass them enough to put the stuff back or tell our managers and then keep an eye out for them again) when we knew one was in the store, everyone came to the floor. Both managers, all the leads, even people in the back in charge of getting big orders out to customers for pickup. With us all on the floor, most shoplifters would give up and leave whatever they were trying to steal on a shelf. 

The first time this family came in, we all quickly focused in on the mother who was the most obvious. She actually came up to some of my coworkers asking us where certain things were, and since we hadn’t caught her actually trying to steal yet (she was acting really shady though) we couldn’t do anything but give her vague answers. After a while they did end up leaving with some stuff bc one of my coworkers got lazy and didn’t care to watch, but we did make the husband and son leave their stuff. None of us had expected the father and son, especially the kid because come on... that’s just sad, but they became uncomfortable because of how honed in on the mother we were. Once they were gone we could do nothing but sigh and move on with our jobs.

The second time they came in, I wasn’t working at the time. I only knew they came back because my coworkers told me when I had come in later the day. They had tried to get out with some expensive shoes and tools, but they ditched them by what was left of our selection of refrigerators. I was also told a week or so later by my manager that when cameras were checked from another store these people had hit, these people actually snuck out the back and stole someone’s car to get away. 

By this point we had actually given these people nicknames and my manager was fuming. I had been told stories about how this woman literally chased down shoplifters in the past, so not being able to get these people was eating at her. About another week went by and the mother and father came back without their kid. My coworker instantly came over to me and told me to watch for her and stay by the mall entrance by my registers. I made my other coworker stay at the registers and watch the changing rooms while I “cleaned” the racks by the mall entrance. The untrustworthy coworker who let them get away the first time was at the other exit and so after a few minutes I went over there while another coworker took my place. I really didn’t trust this coworker to not let them slip out without any issues again. When I got over there I saw my manager on her phone while she was telling another worker to go outside and follow the woman. 

Apparently the shoplifter had walked up to my manager asking where a certain item was, and my manager called the cops right in front of her and told them that there was a shoplifter currently in the store. The woman ran out right as that happened, leaving whatever she had on the counter by the registers on that end of the store. My coworker came back inside and said the lady went into a different entrance to the mall, and my manager began making her way to the back of the mall thinking the husband was meeting her back there like they had before. My manager was gone for over an hour before I saw her again, looking particularly proud. I never got to ask her what happened, but the smug look she had on her face gave me reason to believe the woman and her husband would not be returning to steal again."

Even if customers didn't have a receipt or the item is clearly decades old, 99% of the time managers approve returns. I was working returns that afternoon and business was pretty slow. It was just two of us at the counter and we'd have many three or four people in line, at best.

This older woman came up to my till for a return on deli chicken wings. While I asked her what was wrong with it, I opened the bag to see what we were working with. The most putrid stench of rotting food just blasted in my face. It was as if she'd eaten the chicken, tossed the bones then dug them back out of the garbage for a refund. Keeping a straight face I asked her, ""what was wrong with the food?"" She explained how the chicken was dry and tasteless and that she wanted her money back.

Okay...I asked for a receipt and she told me it was in the bag. I pick through it with the tips of my fingers and lo and behold, the receipt is at the bottom, covered in slime. Except all that ooze ended up erasing all the printer ink on the receipt. So I told her, ""I can't make out the transaction number, I'll have to speak to a manager"" She said ""you do whatever you have to do, baby"" and mentioned how she knew one specific manager. I called that one and he arrived quickly and actually did know the customer! He hugged her and they chatted while he processed her return without receipt. She got her cash back and they let me go wash my hands.

I’m not having a good day. I was fine the whole rest of the day up until I went to work and then everything crumbled. I’m fairly certain I’m getting a flu or cold because, as soon as I entered work, I was cold and hot, mildly dizzy, exhausted, and my left knee is swelling. I’m overweight so the knee isn’t new but it hurts to walk, sit, or get on my knees. I only had a 5 hr shift so I decided to suck it up because I needed the money. 

It was the longest 5 hr shift of my life. 

There was only 20minutes left and I was dead tired. I have a resting jerk face and it’s not getting any prettier as a migraine starts rolling in. 
An elder woman gets in the line and she’s a sassy one. 
“You never said hello to me.”
“Aren’t you going to ask if I have a rewards card?”
She’s not trying to be funny. She’s dead serious. 
What a peach.
I didn’t say anything because 1) Too tired 2) too nice 3) my boss is standing behind me 4) I can see a pick line inserted in her arm so I figure she’s just having a bad day and 5) rude customers are nothing new.
Then she says the line that made me want to chuck her items into the street. 
“You should smile more. Life is too short.”
I about lost it but thankfully I was too exhausted. She leaves and I say nothing. 
Her words have been playing on repeat. The more I think about them, the more I want to scream. I cried in my car because I know that phrase all too well. 
“Life is too short.”
This year I attended a funeral for a friend from work. She died suddenly from a pulmonary embolism and left behind four kids and a husband. She was only 40.
Last year my grandma lost her husband to cancer. She couldn’t attend Christmas the year before because she was too busy feeding him morphine pills so he wouldn’t be in pain. 
The year before that, we lost our uncle on our grandma’s side. He contracted pneumonia when his immune system was already low and my grandma and mom got a call he was dying. That day my grandma lost her younger brother and my mom last herself to alcoholism. 
Every year since 2012, I’ve gone to a funeral due to a death in the family. It sucks every time but I don’t bring my grief to work. Even if Ive had an awful day, I try not to take it out in someone else because that person doesn’t deserve to have their day ruined too. I don’t want to put my pain on a pedestal, I don’t thirst for others pity, but I do want to give perspective. I do however, accept hugs. In fact I shall now give you all a virtual hug.

Maybe even cheer you on from the sidelines. And a message to that lady and all the Karen’s of the world.
Life is too short to spread poison to others who are just trying live their lives.

  A little bit ago I had a customer come into the shop and ask for 3 very specific items. No problem I have all 3! I start to ring said customer out, double checking each product to make sure they are correct for the customer. Then I tell them the total.

  Also we don’t have a website that tells what products we carry and prices this is kind of important.

Me: our website does not have any prices or products on it, are you sure you checked our website?

The customer left in a huff. Well it’s a pretty short one but I find it hilarious that they can’t even read what site they are looking at before running to the closest shop around them thinking that the sale is there.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d2a0ug/im_not_putting_that_in_there_or_how_to_quickly/,"I'm not putting that in there! or, How to quickly disassemble your new crate engine! As long as I've been on the topic of extraordinarily stupid things a certain ex-employer of mine had me do, this one shines. From the world of auto parts.

So I have a guy come to me who wants an engine ordered. Nothing unusual about this. He orders up a mild crate engine (crate engine means fully assembled, usually shipping in a crate).

The engine shows up a week or so later and I give him a phone call to let him know it's arrived. He says he will be by shortly, and sure enough, he was there within the hour.

I ask if he has the core (old engine) with him, but he doesn't, I still have to keep the crate at the store until he returns it though. The crate is used to ship back his old ""core"" engine. I uncrate the engine and hoist it up on a lift and he backs his truck to the loading doors. Just one problem, I've got an assembled engine up on a hoist, and he's got a completely empty truck bed. Like, there's no palette, tires, nothing.

He gets out of his truck and tells me to lower it into the truck bed.

Me: Uh, what are you putting under it?

Customer: What? Nothing, just put it down.

Me: No, definitely not. It can't sit on the oil pan, it'll crush.

Customer: Just bring it down, I'm not going far.

Me: No, you aren't hearing me, it will damage the engine, and it will move.

Customer: Look, I only live a few blocks over the freeway, less than 5 minutes, just put it in.

Me: **NO!** It's dangerous and I'm not doing it. \*I'm getting irritated at this point\*

Customer: It's *my* engine and *my* truck, just load it and I'll deal with it. \*he's getting irritated too\*

Me: I'm sorry, I'm not doing this, you're going to have to come back with a tire and some straps or something, I don't have anything to spare you.

At this point he's gotten angry at my repeated refusals to put the engine in the bed of his truck, he's pissed, I'm pissed and he storms back to his truck. I close the loading doors and get back to other things when the phone rings. I answer, it's corporate.

Corporate: You have a customer picking up his engine there and you are refusing to load it?

Me: YES! It's unsecured! He has nothing to put it on or tie it down with!

Corporate: Have him sign a waiver and load the engine into his vehicle as requested.

Me: What!? NO! It will smash the oil pan or valve covers for sure!

Corporate: Just have him sign the waiver and do it. \*click\*

Fine, fuck it. The guy is already back in the store staring at me so I print up a waiver and have him sign, then lower the engine into the back of his truck. I put it down as gently as I could with the hoist and managed to set it down without crushing the pan. I roll the hoist back inside and he closes his tailgate. 

I go back inside and wash my hands (greasy from hoist).

About ten minutes later, I head outside for a smoke break, and when I get outside, I notice traffic is backed up the hill, very unusual for this part of town and it's a total standstill. I walk out to the road and look down the street. A block down at the peak of the freeway overpass, is Customer and his truck.

Well, most of his truck. The tailgate is hanging off and is bent like a V.

His engine is all over the road. The oil pan is down the street, the valve covers are off, and most of the valvetrain is in the street. Traffic is stopped for BOTH lanes going over the freeway since it's full of engine parts that this guy is now picking up piece by piece.

I just laughed and lit up my cigarette. Had a most enjoyable smoke break while I watched him trying to push the block off the roadway. Then the local PD showed up and ticketed him. A *most* enjoyable break."

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d2aalw/tales_from_the_farmers_market_when_humour/,"Tales From The Farmers' Market: When Humour Backfires. My work here is done… For many years I have been helping out a farmer friend at a couple of farmers' markets. He grows and sells a wide range of organic vegetables, which are freshly picked and beautifully presented at the stall. We both have a quirky (and occasionally dark) sense of humour, and believe that shopping for food should be fun. 

&nbsp;

We've always had quirky signs. Some have images that are Dadaesque, bearing no relation to the product advertised. Some have odd descriptions, some are simply funny marketing (an example of the latter is baby summer squash labelled as ""Squash Kittens""). We've been known to put up signs indicating we're out of a product, or that a much-demanded product is not in season, so you'll see ""Parsnip-Free Zone"" or ""Early birds swiped the baby spinach"". 

One fine morning at market we ran out of something (I forget what, this was years ago) and the empty basket was still sitting out. I took this as a comic opportunity and elected to write a quick sign indicating our lack of product. I settled on ""[Zen Lettuce](https://imgur.com/a/C9OsAdZ)"", scrawled it on the back of an old sign and clipped it to the basket. A few people noticed it and smiled, some passed comment on it and continued the joke. It was successful enough that we did it again. One customer's young son decided this was a vegetable he could deal with and would come to get Zen vegetables every week. Some didn't get the joke and we'd have to explain and dissect the frog¹.

The sign and its variants continued to be a feature at our stand, to the point where we'd sometimes even set up an empty basket at the start of the day so we could put it out. It became a feature along with the banter between the farmer and me.

&nbsp;

Many winters passed. Helpers came and went, but the joke sign would still feature on our display. Cue the bureaucrat. Every so often, someone from the County Agricultural Department would come to inspect everyone at the market. They were supposed to check that our scales were tested and sealed, that our permits and papers were up to date, and that everything we sold was on the list the farmer had approval to grow. You can see where this is going.

I'd just hired some new help. Let's call her Ruth. She was on duty when the inspector came, I was off buying my groceries. I returned to find her in a bit of a tizzy. I'd love for her to tell the story here in her own words, but for now I'll have to paraphrase. The Humourless Bureaucrat makes his appearance.

>***HB:*** I need your paperwork.

>***Ruth:*** There's paperwork?

>***HB:*** Permits, insurance, planting plans, organic certification. It's all supposed to be on display.

>***Ruth:*** *(a little flustered, I'd not told her about the clipboard, though it was clipped to one of the tent struts)* Um…

>***HB:*** You're supposed to present it on demand!

>***Ruth:*** *(finally twigging what the clipboard was for)* Here it is!

>***HB:*** Harrumph.*(Rustles through everything, checks the display, ticks things on his clipboard)*

&nbsp;

The dialogue paused as he went through everything we had out and checked it against our planting plan. There's always a question or two here as sometimes the signs don't *exactly* reflect what's on the papers. Squash Kittens are not listed, for example, and what we grow as ""curly endive"" is on the sign as ""frisee"". 

&nbsp;

>***HB:*** *(After much frantic rustling through ten pages of planting lists)* There's something missing! This ""Zen Vegetable"" is not accounted for!

>***Ruth:*** …

>***HB:*** This is not right! You can't sell something you don't have in the plan!

>***Ruth:*** Well, we aren't actually selling Zen Vegetable.

>***HB:*** You have a basket with a sign for it!  

>***Ruth:*** Well, it's sort of a joke, you see.

>***HB:*** …

>***Ruth:*** *(Explains the joke, dissects the frog. Nobody benefits and the frog dies)*

>***HB:*** *(Leaves in angry bewilderment)*

&nbsp;

After I returned (this had taken some ten minutes), Ruth told me what had happened, to everyone's great delight.

&nbsp;

>***wertperch:*** My work here is done.


&nbsp;

**TLDR:** County Inspector gets upset that they can't complete their damned paperwork due to a comedy sign for a non-existent ""Zen vegetable"". There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth on their part, and barely-concealed mirth on ours. I love messing with a jobsworth bureaucrat.

I worked at a gas station for 6 years and always had a side job for extra money. This story starts at one of my part time jobs at a game store.

I had just started working that day and the ast. manager was there with me. A kid walks in, he's about 15, he ask to look at the used handhelds.
We point him in the direction, and continue to do inventory checks and deal with customers. When the store was empty, he asked the ast. Manager if he could look at one and make sure it works. Thinking nothing of it, he hands him the game system. We were both there, watching him, helping him with questions. He then asked ""does it play those games"" pointing behind us, as we both look back behind us, ""ding dong"" the door alarm. He stole the handheld. We looked at each other as to say ""did that..what?"". Called the cops as we watched him run across the parking lot. He ran behind a store across the driveway from our store.

The cops show up and as I'm describing the kid, i see him walking with his head down from afar.
Apparently the kid had a get away plan with his older buddies and they left cause he took to long. So the cops took him hone and we got the game back.

Now 3 years later, i have quit that game store job but i still worked at the gas station. I was heading into work early and i noticed 2 men running out of the store. My cashier ran outside crying and screaming. I zoomed my truck behind the store thinking that they lived behind the store in a small community and i was going to cut them off. But they were get in a car by the coin operated vacuum and i hit there car, pinning the rear of the car between my truck and the vacuum. I get out of my truck and they get out of the car. They started to run and then stopped. One said to the other ""get the gun"", I panicked and ran to get between their car and them. I chased them across the road. Telling people to stop them, and of course they didn't. I gave up, thinking we have their car the cops can handle the rest. I see the police zoom by us and down the road as im waving trying to flag them down. We had another bigger store 4 miles down the road with the same name. They thought it was that one. As im walking back to the store. I see one of the guys walking back to get the car i guess. 

I lock eyes and said ""come on then!"". He did, we wrestled and i banged up his head a little bit. I noticed he looked familiar. Finally i had him pinned to the ground. My cashiers bf pulls up and i tell him to hold him down as i catch my breathe. Next thing i see is this guy running to the car. Im like ""how the heck you let him up?"" Followed by the thought of that guy saying ""get the gun"". I took of running into the store. 

The cops finally get there, they scan the area. Found 1 of the guys hiding near the railroad tracks. Brought him to the store so we can id him. Then it hit me .. same kid from the game store. WOW.

I totaled out their car and the other guy was caught later.

I (thankfully) don’t work retail any more but kudos to all of you out there still fighting the good fight. 

Anyway I was 17 and I was working my first job at a pretty major US home/furniture retailer and let me say I have never, ever worked at a place that was easier to steal from. Obviously I’m not speaking from personal experience but shrink was a constant and pervasive problem at this store yet for some reason the upper management never took steps to stop it like installing those detector things, having regular security or basically anything besides saying “watch out for people stealing.” 

Anyway, I was a young naïve cashier and one day this lady came in to return all of this bedding and some other random household odds and ends. She didn’t have a receipt (not uncommon at this store we did a lot of returns without receipts) so she could only get store credit and as I told her this I was worried that she would be mad because people usually liked to give me grief for that and she had a ton of stuff but she was cool about it so I was happy and started returning everything. 

As I’m returning all of these items she started telling me about how her engagement was called off and how these had all been gifts she now had no need for and I was doing my best to console this lady as best as a high school who has no frame of reference for that kind of thing can. 

Her return total was something like over $300 so I was like, “oh I need to call a manager over to approve this” since our limit was something like $150 without manager approval. 

Then this lady starts to get nervous for reasons I can’t figure out because she’s about to get $300 in store credit! This is great for her! Then the GM comes and starts looking at things and getting this concerned look on his face and my dumb 17 year old brain still can’t figure out what’s happening. He tells me to just complete the transaction then he calls over the other manager so I do what he tells me but I’m still like ??????

The GM then ran all the product codes through our system aaaaaaand we had no record of ever having sold those items! I was conned into giving some random lady $300 in store credit that was I guess fraudulent. 

The manager (who was known for being a meanie) started yelling at me telling me this lady was going to go sell that gift card for crack and I was just like what crack dealer accepts gift cards to furniture stores? But then the GM (who was a super nice guy) calmed her down and said it was their fault for not training me for things like that so I got to keep my job but boy did I feel like a dumb ass after that one. Still haunts me to this day. And I also have a feeling that lady was never engaged...."

Go ahead, call corporate, I'm not taking it back. Remembered about this thanks to a customer just asking for a refund on parts they didn't buy here. This took place a good while back, and was about enough to make me foam at the mouth. From the world of auto parts, enjoy.

So I'm a manager at a certain corporate auto parts chain. One of the ones that only gets parts from one source, so if you go there, they can either get it, or not. No choices on brands.

A customer comes in with an AC Delco brand part, and puts it down on the counter in front of me.

Customer: I'd like to return this please.

Me: Sorry, you didn't get it here, wrong store.

Customer: Yes, I did.

Me: I don't sell that brand sir, I'm afraid it couldn't have been us. Perhaps XXX Auto Parts over the freeway? 

Customer (now getting upset): I said it was here!

Me: Well, can I have the receipt then?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. \*visibly irritated\*

Me: I'm sorry, I can't take this back. It's really not ours, if you go over to XXX they can probably give you cred.. \*cuts me off\*

Customer: God damn it! I said I got it here! I want to talk to a manag.. \*notices I'M a manager on name tag\*

Customer: Give me your corporate number!

Me: Okay. Here you go, but really, it's not ours. 

I give him the number and out the door he goes and business returns to normal. About an hour later I get a phone call from corporate. I figure he filed a complaint, nope, better.

Me: This is crispysilicon, how can I help you?

Corporate: Yes, you have a customer there in the last hour trying to return a part?

Me: Oh yeah, I know who you mean, the guy came in with an AC Delco part and tried to return it with no receipt.

Corporate: Yes. Give it to him.

Me: ....What? It's not ours.

Corporate: Give him the refund, in cash.

Me: It's not our part.

Corporate: I'm aware of that, issue the refund.

Me: I *can't* take it back, it's NOT ours! It's not in the system!

Corporate: ... Hold. \*puts me on hold\*

A few minutes later...

Corporate: Here is how you will add a new part number to the system \*explaining instructions\*

Me: And the price?!

Corporate: Find it.

Me: How?! We have no internet access remember?

Corporate: Use your phone.

Me: The one I'm not supposed to be carrying?

Corporate: Don't make this an issue, get it done, he's on his way back. \*click\*

Yes, this asshat actually had me use my own personal device, that I wasn't supposed to be carrying, to violate company policy and access the internet on company time. To find an arbitrary price and give a cash refund for a part that wasn't ours. 

Then when he came in, I had to ring it out, because manager with password.

The smug look of satisfaction I had to deal with from this guy as I handed him his victory cash was just icing on the cake. I wanted to slam BOTH our faces into the closest wall repeatedly. Instead, he got exactly what he wanted, and I just looked like a clown."

I use to work in the beauty industry at a retail store. It was a similar store to the orange beauty retailer and similar to the white and black retailer, but it was a much smaller version of them. Anyways...

We had a lady come in and go straight to the Peter Thomas Roth skin care, which was the most expensive skin care brand we had.  I was busy washing brushes and the other associates were helping guests, so we had no idea what was happening. This lady was opening boxes of product and putting the unboxed product into her Louis Vuitton purse, then sticking the boxes on the shelf. Literally everything was caught on camera. Then, she came up to the register to return everything she had just put in her bag. She was hoping for cash or store credit, but since she had no proof of purchase she was denied the return - and she left the store...with all the product. 

Shortly after she left, we found the 5 empty boxes on the shelf and immediately realized what had happened. I immediately called the orange beauty store, which was just across the lot from us, and informed them that they may have a woman coming in to return a ton of skin care product and to not accept the return, and that we had already called the police. The store told me she had JUST left their store after trying to do a return, and she was denied there as well. 

I knew the only other place she would go would be the white and black beauty store about five minutes away, so I called there next. Thankfully a friend of mine answered and she kept me on the line when the woman arrived. My friend had called loss prevention (LP), and she tried to keep the woman at her register until LP showed up. Unfortunately, the woman was onto her and ran out of the store. With no other store in the area that sold the product, we figured that was it and she was going to try to sell on the Facebook marketplace or something for a quick buck, so we waited. We figured the woman wouldn’t be back at either store since we all had eyes on her and knew she was a thief. 

*However*, the very next day I’m at work and the store phone rings - it’s the orange beauty store. The woman has come back to get her hair done, so she’ll be there for at least an hour. We call the police and inform them, and one of my store’s employees runs over to FaceTime the entire thing. 

The police show up, and having already known what happened the day before, they’re ready. They end up arresting this woman with foils still in her hair, and that’s the end of that! Unfortunately we never got the product back, but we had one less person to worry about! 

I really hope that was worth the read. Sorry for any errors!"

He then replies in broken English “is this second hand?”

I stand there and say well yeah we are a charity shop. Nothing is wrong with with it though pretty much new. 

He says “give me 10p back don’t want second hand.” 

We have to fill out this form for any refund and it’s a bit tedious so I’m like sir you did not even take your receipt so I cannot do a refund.” I had put it in the bin as he didn’t ask for it and I was not digging through a bin for 10p. 

He just keep asking for 10p so I got out my wallet and just gave him it out of that. I could not believe he wanted 10p that bad.

Blanche: ""Oh, *Iahm* flyin' on a *commercial* flight.""

Over the summer, I was working at a grocery store in order to have some extra money before I went off to college. One of my coworkers and I were the only cashiers in between the shifts of the morning workers and evening workers (There are four who work in the morning, two who come in when they get off around noon, giving the mid-morning workers about two hours before the evening and night workers come in), and at the same time that week was our double coupon week where, as the name states, coupons are worth double.   


There's a decent lull in customers, so CW and I are just hanging out at our registers, talking about this or that (I was asking if he needed a ride back home, he was asking about when I was heading off to college, etc. Nothing super important) between the few customers showing up.   


Its a bit later when lo and behold, an older lady (OL) comes up with a cart full of items. 

No big deal, that's pretty normal and as I move to go help him bag the items, someone comes to my lane so I apologize and start ringing the customer up.  A few more customers show up and hop into my lane since I tend to work pretty fast and most of them don't have many items to ring up— Fruit which codes I knew by memory, small items, that sort of thing. 

I'm ringing up someone, keeping an ear out for CW since we've had issues in the prior week with haggling attempts and other coupon issues, and I hear CW apologizing.   


CW: I'm sorry ma'am, this coupon isn't ringing up. The system says that it doesn't match the sale.

OL: The coupon says that \[x\] product is 50%

CW: Yes, I know, I can call someone over, but I can't assure you that the coupon will work

(both CW and I had been told to call someone from Customer Service or a manager over if there were issues with coupons, since there were only two of us working register)

OL, huffing: Please, do

By now I figure that CW has if covered, so I'm mostly focusing back on my own work, only slightly glancing over when CW calls our CS Manager (M) over, as he had sent our CS worker on break while he was working on the next week's work schedule.

The manager walks over, asks what the issue is, the usual procedure and CW tells him the issue. At this point, there's no one in my line, so I'm actively listening as I face the end of my lane. Manager scans the coupon, as you do, and the same thing pops up on the register screen. The coupon does not match the previous sale. Manager reads the coupon slowly before he tells her the exact same thing that CW had told her.

M: Ma'am, we can't use this coupon for you today, since you don't have \[x\] (he looks in the bags), you do have \[y\] but \[y\] is not covered by this coupon.

OL: But I got \[y\]

M: yes. But this coupon only covers \[x\] not \[y\]

This goes on for a bit, and by a bit, I mean a good ten minutes, but eventually, OL takes the coupon back in a huff and pays. Not really super climatic, as most people just give up when our Managers show up and firmly tell them that there's nothing to be done, but still.

So I worked at a certain phone company as a “wireless consultant” which is basically just a cashier that can change your phone plan and take your money for accessories and what not.  Well we had a strict policy where if you buy a phone case or something of the sort and want to return it, you have to pay a 25% restocking fee.  People often got annoyed at this so we would have them sign a waiver on the receipt that says they understand this is a rule.

So this elderly Karen looking woman maybe around the age of 70ish comes in to return an item (don’t remember what exactly). Okay that’s fine. I ring up her return and give her 75 percent of the price back to her. 

Cue mental breakdown. She says “I never knew about that policy” and “that is stupid” “I have been with this company for years and you should respect me” blah blah blah. I tell her to give me the receipt so I can look at it. On the back of the receipt it very plainly says in big words “there is a 25% restocking fee on all returned accessories”. Directly under that was her signature.

This escalated even worse and she began yelling and cussing and finally she looked me dead in the eyes and said “if you don’t give me all of my money back I’m going to throw up all over”. I tried to hold back my laughter but I couldn’t help but let the smallest smirk cross my face because of how ridiculous this situation was. 

For context this item was maybe 35 USD new so we are talking like 8 bucks she doesn’t get back. And normally I’d cave for such a little amount and refund the whole thing, however, I was not a manager and did not have to code to do this.

She storms off and walks out the door. Not even 2 minutes later she comes steaming back in slams her finger down her throat and sent her grandma juice all over the phone cases on the wall. 

At this point I was stunned and can’t believe what was happening. I used all of my 7 hour communication training to handle the situation. 

Me: “ma’am please don’t throw up on the merchandise”

Her: *shoves finger down throat and vomits on phone charger accessories*

Me: “ma’am I am going to call the police”

Her: *proceeds to vomit on the counter I was standing behind*

Me: *petrified* 

Her: *starts to leave, and on the way out looks at me, then sends it one more time on the glass door*

Cops come, they honestly had a hard time believing what I said. They told me there wasn’t a whole lot they could do. Manager comes in from her off day and tells me to clean it up. I quit. That was the first and only retail job I ever worked.


TLDR: old woman was mad about restocking fee she knew about. Proceeds to vomit on all merchandise."

I'm not sure how clearance works for other stores, but for ""big southern department"" , it is usually 40% off the last price marked in red. This means that same style clothing can be marked slightly different based on color because the stock of one color was in the store longer than the others,  so its shelf life will show up cheaper than other colors. People get annoyed by this all the time, which is understandable,  and it is hard to explain it to them, but usually they don't mind paying the 1 or 2 dollar difference since it is on clearance price anyway.

SundayBargains comes up to my register with several clearance dresses that are the same style but different colors. I ring them up not really paying attention to the prices until she interrupts. 

SundayBargains: um, why did only one dress ring up 7.99?

Sure enough, I check the last marked price, and only the yellow dress is 7.99 because it was marked lower than the others which were 9.99 after their last marked price. I try to explain to her that because the yellow dress was lower, it was most likely in store longer than the others. Kind of weird, but that's how clearance works. She is not having it.

SundayBargains: that makes absolutely no sense. I want to talk to a manager, and I'm going to  be documenting this and sending it in to corporate! What's your name? You're not even wearing a name tag! Clearly you do this shady stuff all the time if you dont want anyone knowing your name.

Ok, lady,  nevermind I had forgotten my name tag in my purse and was going to just put it on at lunch.

So I get the manager for her, and at first when I'm explaining it over the phone, the manager accidentally hangs up. This drives SundayBargains wild.

SundayBargains: so she hung up on you? I'm adding this to the report. 

Once the manager comes, she explains it the same way I did, and even lets SundayBargains see how the dresses ring up in our system. 

SundayBargains: They are all the same dress! They need to all be 7.99! Let me talk to the manager.

My manager: I am the manager, ma'am. If you would just let me talk, I'd be happy to explain it to you again.

SundayBargains: well I'm reporting this to corporate,  and your name is going in. I am through with this store after this! 

She is taking pics of her phone and filming to make sure she quotes me correctly in her ""report"".

At this point my manager just calls her out for being really aggressive and how she needs to calm down and actually let her explain the store policy. I wander off to help more customers...and when I return, SundayBargains has a smile on her face and says thank you before leaving without the dresses...

Not sure what happened, but jeez louise. All that fuss over 2 dollars....not to mention we had a 10% off clearance coupon, so she would have been getting them,  including the cheaper one for a dollar less. 

I can understand the frustration over not knowing the store policy, but this lady was looking to make a scene over something so simple. Glad we didn't change the price to appease the harpy, anyway. Any other of our managers would have."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d1i03j/what_do_you_mean_different_items_have_different/,"What do you mean different items have different prices? This happened a few months ago, so some of the details are fuzzy, but the gist of it is all there.

I work in a tech store that sells quite a few computers. In our store a decent computer (one that you can work with and not want to rip your hair out) starts at around $650. We also have “value” computers that range from $150-$500. 

One day I am walking my section when I see a woman and her son standing at an end-cap that has a few of our value computers on it. There are three on that particular end-cap. Two are from the same brand with very similar internal specs. The main differences are that one is blue vs silver, and one is 11 inches while the other is 14 inches. These sizes are clearly labeled on both the info card and the box for the computer. 

Anyway, I asked the woman if I could help her. She asked me what the price of the 11 inch computer was, so I told her the price (let’s say $200). I could tell she was already in a bad mood, but she did *not* like my answer. She goes on to tell me that she had been in there about a week ago, picked up a computer from underneath the 11 inch spot and got charged $250 for it. I asked her if she knew which one it was and she pointed to one of the 14 inch ones. I clarified with her that it was the 14 inch one she picked up, not the 11 inch one. She got increasingly upset and asked me if there was any way that I could match that price for her. 

I told her unfortunately I couldn’t price match that item, to which she almost yelled at me that it was false advertising. I told her that normally we would be able to do a price match, but seeing as the box she picked up was clearly labeled differently than the item she was looking at (and since she realized that when she got it), I couldn’t do a price match or change the price. 
Not to be discouraged, she then asked if we could do a price change because the computer was a different color than she thought she was getting (again, very obvious as there is a picture of the computer on the box). I told her no once again and started trying to get out of the conversation. 

After a few times going back and forth she looked at me and basically said, “so I have to pay the extra $50?” I told her “if you want the bigger computer, yes”. She grabbed a computer, sighed dramatically, looked at me, and said “fine, but I’m never shopping here again!” as she stomped off to customer service. I cheerfully replied, “I’m sorry to hear that, I hope you have a great day!”

I learned later that she was looking at those computers that day because she had tried the same story at customer service with a manager before and had already gotten shut down once. 

TL;DR Woman doesn't understand the difference between 11 and 14 inches, demands a price match."

Yesterday while working in a retail store for a mobile carrier, a couple comes in to ask about their phones that are having issues maintaining a connection to their watches.  I wasn't working with them but I was standing close enough to hear the bulk of the conversation.  I was temporarily distracted for a few seconds but I noticed a shift in their conversation.  Apparently while she was waiting, she began closely examining their joint bank account and discovered something that lead her to believe her husband was cheating on her.  They briefly argue with slightly raised voices and she gets up and storms out to the car leaving her smartwatch behind in her haste.  The accused sheepishly walks out behind her without saying a word but you could tell he was absolutely furious because he was cheating and got caught.  The guy is driving and almost runs over two coworkers in front of me and four customer-witnesses while they were attempting to flag Cheaty McCheatface down to return their watch to them.  When he rolled down his window for a few seconds it was g-d-mn this and m0t3rf*cker that.  He then proceeds to violently pull his car across four lanes of traffic and he struck me as the kind of guy capable of domestic violence.

These two folks acted perfectly fine when they walked in and twenty minutes later their whole world shattered.  His reckless driving, disregard for the safety of my coworkers, his inability to remain faithful, and her overall reaction to this revelation of infidelity gave me the impression that the fallout will be swift and severe.  If he hadn't had a very minor problem with his phone which caused him to come into the store in the first place he would have went right on cheating.  Eventually getting caught and delaying the inevitable."

So, this happened about two years ago, so I don't remember the exact words that were used during the confrontation, but it will still give you a pretty good idea. (Also, English is not my native language, so if you see any glaring mistakes, do tell me and I'll correct them XD).

After graduating uni I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my sector (this was before I went back to school to study to become a teacher) and after a couple of months I saw a supermarket half an hour away from my home was hiring and decided to give it a go.   
I was immediately hired as they are always short on staff and I started working the cash register and filling shelves, you know, the usual.  
One day, a woman walks up to me while I'm restocking crisps or something, asking me about a specific brand of milk (I don't remember which brand it was, only that it's not something that we had a lot of, because of rather low demands).   
I follow her to the dairy isle and, indeed, the brand of milk she wanted wasn't there.   
Now, I hadn't been working there long, so I wasn't really sure whether we still had some in the back or not. So I asked her if she was alright with waiting a few minutes while I went to ask a manager.   
She was a bit irritated at the wait (she looked to be in a hurry) but agreed.  
I went to a manager and she told me that we had indeed run out of that brand of milk and that, while the delivery truck could arrive any minute, she wasn't 100% sure when it would arrive (there'd been some kind of traffic jam on the way) and she also wasn't sure if that specific brand of milk would be in that delivery or in the one that was scheduled to arrive the next morning, or a few days after that. (Seeing as this was a rather low-demand product, apparently it could take a few days for a new delivery to be made).  
So I go back to the woman and tell her exactly what the manager had told me, adding that I could ask to hold aside a bottle (or 2, 3, how many she needed) for her the next morning, or any other day and that she could just ask for them at the area where we sold cigarettes and flowers, as there was usually at least one manager/senior store worker working there. I also added that if this were a problem, she could just call the store to ask whether the milk had been delivered already or not, in order to save her an extra trip to the shop. 

Woman: ""What kind of service is this? You always have this brand of milk. You should go look in the back, there's probably still a bottle there.""

Me: ""My manager said we were all out, but I'll go and take a look just to be sure. It's always possible we missed it.""  
I went to take a look and there really weren't any bottles left. I return to the woman and tell her we're out, but that there should be a new delivery of her milk the next morning or in a few days.

Woman: ""There *should* be? So, you're not really sure?""

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm just repeating what the manager told me, so yes, there *should* be a number of bottles coming in soon. But because of the rather low demand, it's always possible it takes a few more days. I can tell you that this brand has not been discontinued, so yes, we *should* get some bottles tomorrow or one of the next days.""

Woman: ""Well, since you're not able to get me my milk, can you please get me the brand of milk that resembles the one I want the most? Because that's the least you can do after wasting my time like this.""

Now, like I said, I hadn't been working there long, plus it was a store that sold a lot of products I'd never heard of, like that specific brand of milk, so I told her I didn't know, but I would go get someone else, whom I knew had been working in the store for several years and knew WAY more about the products than I did. 

The woman then suddenly starts poking her finger in my sternum, forcing me back a few steps, while she lays into me, calling me a 'stupid cow', 'lazy kid', someone who 'doesn't know what she's doing', and how it's a 'disgrace that they allow people like this to serve customers'. 

While I got that she was probably annoyed that her specific brand of milk was not available, and that I wasn't the most knowledgeable person working there, I wasn't just going to let her insult me like that. So I said - amidst her continuous ranting about my incompetence - that I would get someone else to help her, turned around and walked away.

Later, one of the other workers came up to me and said that this lady apparently always gives the workers a difficult time and that I shouldn't think too much of it."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0xuzd/customer_trys_to_return_a_bucket_of_water_in/,"Customer try’s to return a bucket of water in place of paint. Some back story:

I work at a large orange colored hardware store chain. I get a lot of crazy returns like; bricks in drill boxes, rocks in lawnmower boxes, opened and used product, and some things that are just plain ridiculous. However those can make stories in them selves. There are some things you need to know first. 

MOD = The manager on duty

Tint = the stuff you put in paint to make it colored

Alright on to the story!





One day I got a return that was a 5 gallon bucket of paint. I go to open the bucket and it’s water. They guy returning it insisted  that it was paint and that it was “defective”. So I called the MOD and he came over and was like “what’s the problem” and I replied “this guy is trying to return a bucket of paint and it’s water” he then opens the bucket, conforms it’s water, and says to the customer “Well there’s the problem, you just haven’t mixed it. If you want we can take you over to the paint desk and have it mixed.” To which the guy (not wanting to admit he’s wrong) hesitantly says “sure let’s do that.” So I watch as the MOD has the paint desk put tint in a bucket of water and mix it all the while the customer is standing there with look of defeat. The customer eventually left with his bucket of colored water and was “satisfied”."

Around 9:20-ish AM, I had a regular customer come in. She is notorious for coming in drunk and she normally walks to and from. She comes up to the counter and I *immediately* tell she's hammered. Slurred/mumbling speech, slow blinks, a sway in her movement even while 'still', and finally once she spoke up, the smell.

She asked for a cigar and matches (after much difficulty and a building line behind her) and after paying she's on her way...that is until I lament to the customer behind her that ""wow she doesn't seem done with last night's partying. She is suuuper drunk.""

My customer notices that...

*She is getting into her car. She was and will be driving while impaired!*

I had a line of customers, so I asked if it wouldn't be too much trouble for him to call for me. He eagerly does so, and is ready to even go distract her to keep her there if need be (for reference I was alone at the time since my manager had to make a bank run).

Thankfully, firefighters were out collecting donations for their annual benefit, and we had an officer in less than 20 seconds, actually while my customer was talking with dispatch. The officer got out and spoke with her a bit until more showed up. 

A few minutes later they were having her walk lines, and by then my manager returned so I filled him in on what happened. When he was out there he said the lady was told *three times* what to do because she wouldn't put her foot down. 

Needless to say she was arrested, we gave them footage of her driving into the lot (undeniable proof she was driving), and her mom picked up the car."

For context, I need to give a description of how the credit card machines in my job work (this is important to the story.) This might be a little confusing but I'll do my best to explain. The credit card machines in my workplace turns on the contactless feature automatically when the sale begins, once the subtotal of the sale goes over €30 the machine automatically turns the contactless feature off and there is no way to manually turn it back on again, the machine does this because in my country you are only allowed pay contactless using your credit card for payments up to €30, and more than that is illegal because there is a risk of credit card fraud. However,  you are allowed to pay with contactless using your phone and there is no limit. But the credit card machines in my workplace haven't been updated to accommodate this, once the limit goes over €30 euro you can't pay using contactless regardless of whether you're using a phone or a credit card. This has been causing problems for a while because customers come in and try to pay for shopping over €30 with their phone and I then have to explain why it won't work. Most customers just say ""oh ok"" and pay using an alternative method of payment, a couple of customers get annoyed but only one customer has ever caused a big fuss about it, and this customer is the star of the story.

I was serving customers on the till when the customer approached with her shopping, we where making small talk as I was scanning and bagging everything and she seemed really nice at first. The problem arose when she wanted to pay with her phone but the total was over €30. I explained to her why she can't pay with her phone but she doesn't believe me.

Customer: ""No, you're wrong.""

Me: ""Um, excuse me?""

Customer: ""You're wrong. You just need to press the contactless button.""

Me: ""Ma'am, we don't have a contactless button here. The machine turns contactless on and off automatically.""

Customer: ""No it doesn't. You just haven't pressed the contactless button yet that's why it's not working.""

Me: ""I can't, we don't have a contactless button here. I have no manual control over the contactless function on the credit card machine. It's automatic.""

Customer: ""You do have control over it. You're just not listening to me. I'm trying to show you how to do your job but you just don't want to listen""

Me: ""I am listening to you but what your asking me to do is impossible because we don't have a contactless button.""

She starts to shout attracting the attention of other people in the store.

Customer: ""YES YOU DO. THAT'S HOW TO CREDIT CARD MACHINES WORK IN MY JOB SO THAT MUST BE HOW IT IS HERE!!!""

Me: ""Your workplace must use a different credit card system to ours.""

Customer: ""NO IT DOESN'T. ALL CREDIT CARD MACHINES ARE THE SAME.""

She then tells me to call a supervisor so that she can have someone who ""actually knows what they're doing"" to finish the sale. The supervisor arrives and I try explaining the issue but the customer cuts me off.

Customer: ""No that's not the problem. The problem is that he won't press the contactless button.""

The supervisor looks confused.

Supervisor: ""Um, ma'am we don't have a contactless button on our tills.

The customers starts screaming again.

Customer: ""YES YOU DO!!!""

Then the customer and the supervisor gets into a long argument about which one of them were right. The argument goes on for about 5-10 minutes and comes to an end when the supervisor tells her to see for herself.

Supervisor: ""Fine, if you don't believe me then how about you come back here and show me where the contactless button is.""

The customer looks unsure.

Customer: ""Oh, no, that's ok.""

But my supervisor insists.

Supervisor: ""Well if you're certain you're right then you should have no problem coming back here and proving us wrong then, will you?""

The customer comes back uncertainly and looks at our till.

Supervisor: ""Well? Please show me where the contactless button is.""

Customer: ""I... I don't see it.""

My supervisor tries unsuccessfully to hide his big smug grin.

Supervisor: ""Do you believe me now?""

The customer gives him a dirty look but doesn't say anything. She just walks back to the other side of the counter and takes out her purse.

Customer: ""I guess I'll pay by card then.""

I finish the sale and the customer says thank you and leaves without looking me or my supervisor in the eye. My supervisor looks victorious.

Supervisor: ""Don't worry about her, she was just looking for an argument.""

He then walks off. He was definitely my favorite supervisor."

I get told by my one of my colleagues to keep an eye out for the older man at the end of my till because he’d be seen eating food from the bakery while walking round the store. He was looking at the magazines while waiting and I could see him eating a donut. 

He was with his (what I presume) wife and had a small amount of groceries and 3 large boxes of gardening equipment. So I scan all this through and it comes up to around £230 or so. 
Sometimes, customers will pay for their items separately. So I assumed this and ask them to pay, but still no mention of the donut. He’s still chewing. 

At the end of the transaction, I asked him: “shall I put the donut through now” 

He was not happy to say the least. His tone completely changed and seemed very taken aback that I’d even dare ask him to pay! It went something along the lines of:

Customer: “I thought as I’ve spent so much in here I could have the donut” 

Me: “No, you still need to pay.” 

(Doesn’t say anything) 

Me: “is their anything else you’ve eaten” 

(He’s really not happy now lol)

C: “ no I haven’t been here for long *gestures at his shopping*  I’ve only had time to eat one. If I was here longer I would’ve had 12” 

No idea how he said that with a serious face. 

Anyway I’m fairly certain he had more that one as a couple of different people saw him eating and our bakery is at the opposite end of the store to our check outs.

Me: “ok, so that will be 29p”

He seems completely shocked that I’m actually charging him for it and storms off out of the store leaving his wife to pay. 

Later on, I get told he was grazing the grapes too."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d138ba/youre_wrong/,"""You're wrong!"" (TL;DR at the end) This guy is by far the rudest regular customer we have (not the most annoying though, that's a story for another time). He quite regularly tells his kids ""naw yer no having that, yer too fat!"" when they ask for a bar of chocolate. For reference, I work in a petrol station in the UK. The shop is quite small, and while I dont know the price of every item, I do know the price of some of our more popular items (coke, Pepsi etc.). 

So this guy comes in today, gets some milk, crisps, cereal, and a bar of chocolate. After the transaction is finished he forgot he wanted some diet coke. Normally he gets a 4-pack of cans, but we were all out so instead he got a 1.75L bottle. He bring it's up to the counter, I scan it, and that's where the fun starts

Me: ""thats £1.89 for that one""

Him: ""it said £1 on the shelf""

Me: ""thats for the 1.25 litre bottle, this one is 1.75 litre"" (I knew this because I get a 1.25L bottle each shift, plus the 1.75L bottles are price marked at £1.89 each or 2 for £3)

Him: ""oh ok""

He pays, and I start serving a customer that came in while he was paying. I see him walk over to the shelf where the large bottles are, looking intently at the labels. I finish serving the other customer, and the rude guy then pipes up ""you're wrong! It says here £1 for diet coke! Come here right now and I'll show you how you're wrong!"". Now, sometimes after a promotion finishes some of the labels get missed when we are changing the signage. However, the only promotion the 1.75L bottle has ever been on is the ""2 for £3"" promotion that's marked on the bottle, not £1. So I go over to where he is standing by the shelf to show him that it is him that's wrong. Now, on the shelves the 1.25L bottles are right next to the 1.75L bottles. So I can see how it would be confusing for someone with bad eyesight, or if they just aren't paying attention. But this guy is just plain arrogant. He points to the sign that says ""£1 Diet Coke/Coke Zero 1.25L"" and says ""see its £1!"". I say ""aye, for the 1.25 litre bottle, as it says there"" then point to the label for the 1.75L ""and that's the 1.75 litre, at £1.89"". He then starts ranting about how it's ""false advertising"" to have the 1.25L next to the 1.75L and that I need to ""move those right now!"". I simply tell him that I am not permitted to rearrange the shelves without approval from the manager, who has to get approval from the merchandisers in an office down in England. After some more ranting, he leaves, shouting ""get them told!"" as he walks out the door.

In my department store, our return policy for one particular type of shoe have a limited return policy, meaning that it can be returned within a certain amount of days. We tell this to every customer who buys these shoes, and it's on the back of the receipt as well, and we are not allowed to make any exceptions.

Anyway, I just clocked in and am starting to get to work. This woman, an older black lady (who will be called Rude Customer), came over to me with a box in her arms. I approached her.

ME: Good afternoon. Do you have a return?

RUDE CUSTOMER: Yes ma'am.

We went to my register and began to start the return. Immediately, I get a notification on my computer saying that it was past the last possible return day for the shoes. Oh great.

ME: I'm sorry, ma'am, but I cannot return these shoes because it's past (insert amount of days), and I cannot do a return past it.

Insert the ""rude"" part of her title.

RUDE CUSTOMER: No, honey. I didn't hear anything about that. You can do whatever you need to do. I just need to return them.

ME: I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

RUDE CUSTOMER: Call your manager.

Insert eye roll. I get the phone and call my manager. My manager came over and immediately took over the transaction. I wondered off just so I can calm down, but I heard some brief raised voices and saw the lady storm off. Whatever. I continued with my day. Shortly after I get a different customer, who was really sweet, her pair of shoes, my coworker came over to me, looking a bit angry, with the phone to her ear.

COWORKER: Hey OP. That lady came back and told me to tell you, ""Tell that black girl to tell whoever she called that I found corporate's number and I'm gonna call them!""

If you’ve ever worked or been in a store during liquidation, you’ve definitely noticed the crazy sales that go on. In this store we increased the percentages every week on Thursday. I usually got scheduled before opening along with a couple other coworkers to change all the sale signs that needed to be changed. During the week this story takes place I changed the signs for small appliances, bedding, most of the women’s clothes, and some kids. It was extremely hard to keep up with all the changes, but we did our best and if one worker didn’t know the sale, another would, so 99% of the time we could figure out the actual sale price instead of relying on customers. If I changed any of the signs, I was able to remember the sales for that section easily and never made a mistake with those.

A lady comes to the register with an iron. This was part of small appliances and during this week they were 40% off. I made sure it rang up for that and went to continue the transaction.

Customer- “This is supposed to be 50% off.”

Me- “No ma’am, all small appliances are 40%. Are you sure you got this from the correct shelf?”

Customer-“ Yes. there was a 50% off sign beside this and all the other irons were beside it. You need to honor that price.”

Me- “I’m sorry but I can’t change the sale. I know these are 40% off.”

Customer- “No it says 50%! You have to sell it to me for that!”

She makes me walk over to where they are. I look and I see a 50% off sign just sitting on the shelf. I was the one who changed the signs in this sections so every sign was supposed to be taped up onto the shelves. Now what was 50% was the bedding right beside small appliances. I pick it up and say, “This doesn’t belong here. It looks like it fell from over here --*I point to bedding--* and someone just set it here. I’m sorry ma’am.”

I start walking back to the counter to put the sign up while I work until I can tape it back where it was supposed to be with her snapping at me the whole way.

Customer- “You have to sell me the iron for 50% since someone put the sign there! You need to honor this!”

Me- “I can’t. Every other sign in that section says 40%, and this sign was obviously just set there.”

Customer- “You people need to get better at your job then instead of putting the wrong signs everywhere! This is false advertisement! I’m going to go get your manager!”

After she left I went to go take the sign back, and when I got a closer look, I realized the sign had actually been *ripped off* the bedding shelves and put by the iron the lady was trying to buy. I put two and two together and realized this crazy woman had tried to trick me into selling her the iron for cheap by switching signs around.

Never saw my manager that day, and never saw her in the store again.

So many people tried things like this while I was working, but none of them had ever actually switched signs around. It was actually pretty entertaining once I realized what the lady had done."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0rr82/apparently_we_are_horrible/,"Apparently we are horrible Ok. So another story from my job. 
I work in a retail store that sells home decor and furniture. Anytime we have to order something for a customer sent to our store, it comes with our freight truck. We have a policy of calling all customer orders the day they get there, so that they can hopefully come get them ASAP. So, we got freight on a Monday. I sat with my freight manager as she called all her orders and left voicemails. 

The next day, my associate gets a call asking of a customer order has come in. She checks our system and the stockroom and informed the customer that it was here. 

This customer lost it over the phone. She started yelling about how she never received a call or email. How it should be our policy to call our customers when their orders arrive. And this was horrible customer service. 

My associate apologizes to the customer, thinking she got missed in the call list. And then after hanging up brings this to my attention. I ask her what the order name is. I knew for a fact that this lady had been called AND emailed. So I just figured the lady needed to yell at someone and let it go. 

Two days later, my associate comes to the back, saying this customer claims her two chairs are missing legs. I tell my associate to tell the customer that they are in the zipper compartment under the chair, along with all the hardware and tools needed. A few minutes pass and my associate calls me to the register for an issue. I come up and ask the customer what is going on. She starts going off on me about how she borrowed a truck to come get these chairs and got them home and there are no legs. And NOW she's being told that they are under the chairs.


I ask her why she didn't just call us when she thought the legs were missing. 


That apparently made her more angry. She started yelling about how we weren't doing our jobs by telling everyone where the legs are. And it's ridiculous that she had to borrow a truck to bring them back. So she's just done with them. Return them. We were horrible.

It took everything I had to just respond with, ""ok."" And process the return. 


Just as a side note, we tell our customers when they order that there may be some assembly required. The instructions are normally very clear but if they have issues they can call us. And we have even put the items together when requested. But this lady didn't even try at all. These chairs weren't even out of the boxes."

This girl worked with me, we'll call her H. H came to work, did her thing, went home. Then, come September she leaves for uni. 

Fast forward to summer the following year and i'm serving at the Kiosk. This is where the tobacco, lottery and spirits were sold. A girl, looking around 15 approaches me with a bottle of Vodka. I say hello and take the item. Then I ask for ID (Think 25 rule, she didn't even look 16 let alone 25 but still.) She hands me a driving license. I look at it and lo and behold, it's H's ID. This 15 year old was H's sister. So I asked her to confirm her age. She stumbles, says 19, then i ask her DoB, she can't remember the year haha.  I asked her how H was doing at uni and passed her back the ID. At this point she's panic stricken and runs from the shop."

I sold a woman an equipment item. Later that day she comes in wanting to return this item and my co-worker helps her. 

C- customer
J- co-worker

C- hi, I bought this item earlier today but I found the same one at another store for cheaper so I bought that one and I want to return this one. 

J looks at the item which has clearly been opened and gestures to the multiple policy signs in that items location 

J- I'm sorry we don't offer refunds on these items once they have been opened, but I can give you credit or exchange it for you. 

C- what do you mean? I just bought it a few hours ago. 

J reiterates the policy 

C- is (our managers name) here? I've never had a problem before. 

J- no she isn't, this is a new policy. But if you have an issue with our policies you can call customer service. 

C- fine 

And she leaves the store. She them returns maybe 20 min later saying she can't find the customer service number can we give it to her. J finds the number and starts to write it down when this woman starts going off on her. 

C- you know this is really inconvenient for me. I have spent hundreds of dollars here and I don't need two of the same thing! 

J- I'm sorry you bought two but I don't make the policies. 

C- how would you like it if someone refused to give you a refund like this!? What's your name?

J says her name 

C- oh of course you're a ""J""..

I'm next to her thinking like I don't know what ""J"" screwed your husband but chill.. 

J- look here is the phone number. You have no reason to be personally attacking me. You have the number you can leave now.

Customer storms out. An hour or two later we get a call from home office and they want to speak to J, basically ask what happened. So she tells them what happened, in the mean time they are having the customer e-mail a picture of the item to them so they can determine if it was opened or not. Apparently she couldn't figure out how to send the picture so we are told to just refund the item. Luckily neither of us was there when she came back because according to the co-worker who DID return it for her, when she came in she didn't bring the receipt and when she told her our system literally won't allow a cash refund without the original receipt so of course she was huffing and puffing about how this store was out of the way for her and all this crap. 

Later, our manager tells me she messaged her on her personally Facebook telling her that this never shoukd have happened and she will not he shopping at our store anymore. 

Good riddance if you ask me."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0qkof/getting_yelled_at_because_i_wont_break_store/,"Getting Yelled At Because I Won't Break Store Policy Background: I work at the customer service desk in a membership-based warehouse chain. I've been working at the store for two years, and at customer service since the beginning of the summer.

Every so often, our store mails out flyers that people can bring in to either 1) Get a free 3-month trial membership or 2) Get a full-year membership for less than half the normal cost. The free trial is for new customers only (and says as much in large text right under the offer), but the discounted offer is good for anyone, even to renew an existing account.

The other night, a woman (W) and her husband (H) walk up to me with the flyer in hand:

>W: Hi, I'd like to use this free 3 month offer, please.

>Me: Have you ever had a membership with us before?

>W: Yup, I have, but it expired.

>Me: Unfortunately, as it says on the flyer, the trial is only good for new members. If you'd like to renew your existing account, I can process the renewal at the discounted rate of $25 (rather than the regular $55).

>W: (getting annoyed) Well they've done it for me before.

>Me: Even if I was allowed to per corporate policy, our computer system won't allow me to process a trial if you've already been a member.

*This is actually true. If we try to open a trial membership, the computer system will search for a matching driver's license in existing accounts and block the new account from being opened.*

>W: (Pissed off) FINE. WELL MY HUSBAND HAS NEVER BEEN A MEMBER SO I'LL HAVE HIM DO IT.

Before I can say anything, she yells:

>W: [HUSBAND]! COME OVER HERE!

H comes over, looking confused.

W gestures at me.

>W: HE'S TRYING TO TELL ME THAT SINCE WE'VE BEEN MEMBERS BEFORE, WE CAN'T DO A TRIAL. SO OPEN UP A CARD IN YOUR NAME.

We technically can't refuse this, so I ask for his ID. Valid identification is required no matter what.

>H: Oh... I don't have my wallet with me.

>Me: Without some form of ID I won't be able to process a new account at all. I can still renew your existing account, though.

>W: WILL I STILL BE ABLE TO SHOP IF I DON'T RENEW?

>Me: Yes, but you'll be charged a 20% surcharge for shopping as a non-member.

*We used to make exceptions to this rule and offer a ""grace period"" after expiration, but people started to abuse it so we began enforcing it as a hard limit.*

>W: FINE. I GUESS I'LL DO THAT THEN!

Later on, I actually saw her again as she was leaving the store (I also occasionally check receipts at the front door, and was covering a break at the time). She glared at me as she walked out and very sarcastically said ""YOU TOO!"" When I told her to have a good night."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0om7j/im_gonna_sue_you_guys_for_damages/,"I'm gonna sue you guys for damages. **Just for some background:**

I work in an awards/trophy/gift shop and most of our business comes from engraving items and awards. The only people that work there are me and my boss who owns the place. I do all the engraving with our laser machine and sometimes help run the shop if my boss needs to go out of town.

My boss had left the shop for two weeks because she had some family visiting at home and I was left running the shop.

**And now for my new favorite customer to come in:**

One fine Tuesday, this guy comes to the shop with an engraving order. I got the details and essentially this guy owned a funeral-type business and he needed a small tag engraved with a name and dates. The whole time the guy is in my shop he is acting a bit odd  eg. staring at another guy who was waiting to be helped and talking about how my predecessor was ""something"" (my predecessor is actually a very nice guy thank you), and walking into the neighboring business after he left just to eat their free candy.

After the whole transaction was complete I told the guy that he could pay when he picked it up and that I could have the order done *""either this week or in the first half of next week""* due to us having other orders\*\*.\*\* The guy left without so much as a farewell.

Now, I had talked to my boss about the order because she briefly came in the next day to handle a couple things and noticed the order. Apparently this guy comes in every few months with these orders and always gives trouble and is a bit of an oddball so of course she warned me about him.

Fast forward a few days to Friday in the morning. I was chilling out at home for a couple hours before I had to head in to work. I then got a call from my boss saying that she received a call from the same guy who is apparently at our store before we open and called her because he hadn't received his order. The guy said that the funeral service the tag was needed for was at Noon that day and that he needed the tag before then. My boss just wanted me to tell her where the file was for it and then proceeded to go into the shop and engrave the tag. The guy (understandably) hadn't waited around for my boss to come in and engrave the tag and had said over the phone that he would be in when it was ready. Apparently the guy also told my boss that I had said I could get the order done in two days (this is second hand from my boss). I KNOW I never said that because I **NEVER** give an exact amount of days for me to complete an order if I don't need to (because I cant always tell how long every single order is going to take).

My boss got the tag done, called him, and waited around until 11:30 for him to come pick up the tag.

**He didn't.**

So later on I came in, opened up the shop (about 11:45 since the store was opening late while my boss was gone) and proceeded to have a very quiet day until about 3:45-4:00PM when you know who comes in. The absolute first thing the guy tells me is that he's never doing business with us again (ok, whatever dude) and then asks how much the order is. While I'm entering the order into our register, the guy says ""I'm gonna sue you guys for damages."" and follows it up with ""I told the family that they didn't get their tag because of you guys so you'll be hearing from them too!""

The guy paid for the order and left and I of course immediately ran to the back and busted my gut laughing. I felt obligated to call my boss because we had just been threatened with a lawsuit but she just laughed it off as well.

I want you all to understand, if this guy would have said he needed the tag by Friday at Noon I would have gotten it done the day before but **he didn't.**

**TL;DR** A pretty weird guy comes in to my shop, order a funeral tag, gets mad that it isn't done in two days (despite me telling him it might not be until next week), and threatens to sue my work over it."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0kyq4/the_great_mayonnaise_debate/,"The Great Mayonnaise debate This story took place about two weeks ago at work. It was a Saturday, a coupon day, and of course the place is packed to the brim, being the only store around for miles. Late into a grueling 9 hour shift, an old woman comes up to the register with a cart containing just one thing- a jar of store-brand mayonnaise. I ring it, total it, and tell her the price -$3.25.

""Wait. That isn't right. Isn't it supposed to be on sale for $3?"" She asks. ""I'm not sure, let me go check the tag where it was."" She has the wrong brand, of course. I explain this to her and she gets extremely irritated. I then pick up a store sale ad next to the register and show her the specific sale she's looking for. ""See, you picked the store brand tub. The one that's on sale is the Kraft squeezable tube."" She then proceeds to demand that I give her the discount, and I politely told her I couldn't do that since the item she got wasn't on sale. ""It was with the other mayo, I should still get the discount!"" She yelled. By this time, she's held up the line and 15 people are behind her while my manager had to take them on the other register. She gets irate and screams ""Can't you f_cking read? It's clearly on sale!!"" At this point I'm about to lose it on her, so I very curtly tell her ""You have a tub of *store brand*. The one that's on sale is *Kraft brand*. In other words, your item is *not on sale*. ""

She slams the mayonnaise on the counter, slams the cart against the register and screams ""F_ck it then! You youth are so f_cking disrespectful!"" Which left the entire store in an awkward silence as my manager watched from the other register.

All of that over 25¢."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0kxze/is_there_nobody_for_this_cart/,"Is there nobody for this cart? Generic info line - I work as a department head in a store that has grocery, general household goods, apparel, electronics, etc. and sometimes am on the register for shifts or breaks as needed.

This morning I was covering the cashier's first break and I had a woman who had a gallon of milk that had somehow gotten smashed and was leaking. I informed her and she asked if it was ok to run and get a new one. I said sure, it wasn't far and she had a fair amount of things I needed to ring up. I was only about hallway through when another woman comes up to my register.

We'll call her Miss Impatient.

Miss Impatient looks at the merchandise on the belt, looks at me, looks at the cart I'm putting stuff into, says ""is there nobody for this cart?""

It took all my restraint not to sarcastically say ""do you think I'd be ringing it up if there was nobody getting it?""

Me ""she went to go grab a new milk because it was leaking""

Miss Impatient starts tapping one of her items on the belt aggressively.

I keep scanning. She starts talking under her breath, complaining about the wait.

We have sco and 6 other registers open, for the record.

The customer I was ringing up came back and I hear Miss Impatient say ""about effing time"" she continues huffing, tapping her item (one of 6 things she had) and muttering to herself.

The customer in front of me had coupons. Miss Impatient whines to herself. The customer in front of me wanted to do a split payment, part cash, part card. Miss Impatient looks like she's gonna have a heart attack over this.

I finally get to her order.

Me ""did you find everything ok?""

Silence. Ok. I finish ringing I tell her the total then ask ""Did you have a store loyalty card or any coupons?""

""I don't have time for this sh!t! I gotta catch my bus! Why did that lady have so much stuff? This isn't a grocery checkout."" (It's slightly separated from the other registers by the customer service desk)

Me as I'm handing her the receipt ""this isn't a limited item checkout so it's ok to bring a full cart over here""

Her ""well it shouldn't be, I'm going to call corporate and tell them that. I'm going to miss my bus now.""

She walked out. It's not the first time I've had someone tell me this register should be limited. It's just another thing that happened. I'm just baffled by her asking me, while I'm scanning items, if nobody was there for the transaction I was ringing up. Like lady, why the hell would I be ringing it up if nobody was buying it?"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0lhx7/i_threw_a_customers_shoes_in_the_bin/,"I threw a customers shoes in the bin This story happened a couple of years go, while I was still an apprentice at the shoe company I work at. Now the store I worked at that time, had something called a clearance section. Basically all the shoes in that section were discontinued lines and were reduced to sell. However because of where that section is located in the store, shoes often get stolen and we usually only find out by finding a old pair of shoes shoved on the rack or left by stools, as the stock can't be monitored properly due to not being in the system anymore. 

Anyway so this story happened in the summer, which makes the shop incredibly busy. My manager tells to go get some stock from upstairs, as I go up I notice this girl with an older lady trying on shoes, between the kids and clearance section. I think nothing off it and go and get the stock, I return about 15 minutes later to find them gone and a pair of old dolly shoes on the floor, now at this point I do nothing, but I make a mental note to keep an eye on them. At that point I have no idea whether a customer is the just trying on shoes, a customer has bought shoes and just left their old ones as that did happen sometimes or someone had stole some shoes and walked out with the new ones and left the old ones.

So over the next 40 minutes( I know it was 40 as it took  about 25 minutes to put the stock out and someone else went up to get some more, which takes 10-15 minutes) I walk past the shoes 5-6 times as I go to get shoes from the stockroom for customers. The last few times I make a mental note to try to remember to do something with the shoes, as by that point I was sure they had been left there and the customer had left the store.

My colleague returned from the stock room and my manager asked me to go round and tidy the store the best I could, as usual I started at the back in the clearance section which always got trashed within 5 minutes after it getting tidied and it took me a good 5 minutes to get it somewhat presentable, i'm about to start on kids when I notice the dolly shoes again, still in the same place and untouched. I pick them up and ask all the customers around me if they owned the shoes, all said no, so I went and placed the dolly shoes by the till while I finished tidying the store.  I have had customers walk off before and leave their shoes while they tried on shoes, but they always kept an eye on the location and customers always came back when staff were by their shoes, so nothing happened to them. 

I finished tidying the store and went back to the till, the dolly shoes still went unclaimed. So I took them to the bin outside and threw them out. Now if this was a bag, we would have put it in the back, but because of the location of the shoes, the length they were and the fact that no one claimed them, made it safe to assume someone had left them there on purpose.  They were left there for well over an hour. I wish this was the end of it but it's not.

About 10 minutes after I'd thrown the shoes out, a lady comes to me and asks me, if I had seen the dolly shoes. Looking back I should have lied, but she caught me off guard. I told her that they had been thrown into the bin outside. That's when everything kicked off. I attempted to explain the situation, but she wouldn't let me get a word in edgeways. My manager took over the situation and never once did she blame me. However the family of the woman was with kept coming to verbally attack me, twisting my words saying that I never asked if someone owned the shoes and If I did I was too quiet, going as far to say they couldn't hear what I was saying to them at that moment. My manager cut in saying that they wouldn't of heard me if they were down by the till, but that they should have noticed the shoes when I placed them behind the till.

This didn't stop them from attacking me, in the end my manager had to send me to the stock room just so they'd leave me alone. I came back down and my manager was in the office talking to customer services, the family is standing outside. It isn't long until the woman comes back in and starts having another go at me, despite my manager handling the situation.  My colleague went to get my manager and they both came out. My manager said customer services had told her, we had to retrieve the shoes from the bin as that is what the family wanted, which we did. The family weren't happy and accused me of lying to them saying I said I threw them in the back bin and were soon back on the phone to customer services. 

They came back in and started attacking me again, saying that customers services had said they could have a free pair of shoes up to £10. Now that may not seem like an attack but it was the way they did it. I can't explain it. Anyway I say i'm not authorised to say anything and to talk to my manager, something they weren't happy about. My manager agrees to it as she's had a call from customer services to let her know. But the woman comes at me again saying, I've done harm to her granddaughter. 

My manager walks off the floor and while she's off the floor the father of the girl, tries to remove a security tag from the shoes she's chosen over the counter. My colleague stops him and places the shoes under the till, stating that my manager has to deal with it. They fight back saying they are entitled to a free pair of shoes and that's what they were doing. However until it is processed through the till, it's still classed as theft.

Any way it all gets processed and they begin to start on me again, stating that the grandma, worked in another retail store and she would have been fired, if she had from customers belongings out. My manager sends me on my lunch to get me away from them again.

When I come back from my lunch, my manager says the family lied to customer services. Apparently they told customer services that the shoes I threw out, were worth £50 and were branded, when I fact they were only worth  £4 from the shop they bought them from and certainly weren't a high end brand. My manager happily sent the evidence to head office. She also deduced that the family were after a free pair of shoes from the start.

My manager replies with “A whole lotta goodness.” She laughs at this, and says that she is Diabetic and we are gonna make her sick with all the good looking items. She then asks what my manager’s favorite brownie is. “Pecan.” She says. The woman was sweet the whole time and ends up getting the pecan. We package her up and she goes about her merry way. About half an hour goes by and she walks back in. She asks if she can speak with our manager, and we were all terrified. The manager asks if there was a problem, to which the woman said no, but wanted to tell us that the Brownie “knocked her on her ass.” She turned around and came back to the Bakery to tell us how good her Brownie was! She started taking a lot of free samples of our fruitcake. She explained that she had a lot of dogs in the car and was taking them for the dogs, I told her we have dog treats and can give her free ones for the pooches.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0jc15/the_saga_of_the_most_obsessive_scammer_ever/,"The Saga of the most obsessive scammer ever. So last week we had an elderly gentleman come up to the paint desk needing some help. I had just finished with someone else's order, and my coworker was still busy so I go up to help him. He says something along the lines of

>Are you the best paint mixer here? No? I wanna talk to that older guy then

So I pass him onto my coworker, and he wants 2 gallons of deck stain in an ugly burnt orange color. Each can of stain costs about $45 for reference. Coworker makes it for him, and he goes 

>I don't like this color can you make it darker

Wonderful, he's gonna be that guy while we're swamped. So for whatever God forsaken reason he doesn't care that I take over and darken it. While I'm doing it he keeps hollering

>yeah make it darker, add some black to it! Yeah make it darker, add some brown and black to it!

And he keeps repeating himself. I didn't bother explaining that just adding that would ruin the orange color and make it like a muddy color, so I make it a richer version of the orange. He still wasn't satisfied. He then opens back up the book and points to a new color, and this one is a medium shade of brown. Now all the red flags are going off in my head.

So we have a wonderful little clearance rack full of ugly colors people brought back or didn't take with them in the first place. These paints are sometimes marked down almost 90%. This guy wanted to get these off said rack, and we knew it right then. But of course, we can't call him out on it.

So I make 2 more cans, and, guess what, he doesn't like these colors either. It's going on an hour I've been stuck with him now, and my manager walks up, I fill him in, and tell him I'm about to blow a gasket on this guy, so he takes over. Dude had been condescending the whole time and I had had it. (The stress of Labor Day weekend and all)

The guy then says he wants the darkest brown we have. My manager tells him to go to an actual paint shop because they'll have more color options. He leaves. I change the colors on his 4 gallons and put them on the clearance rack. But we weren't done with our friend, not by a long shot.

**Part 2**

A few hours later, the only folks left in the paint department were me and another coworker. My manager and the other coworker had gone home. And in walks the old man (it's around 7, we close at 10).

Shoot me.

>Hey you still got those 4 gallons?

>No sir I don't

(I do)

>Did you sell them all that quickly?!?

>Yes sir I did

>Did you get full price???

>Dunno, I was at lunch

*Speech 100*

A few minutes later he comes up to me again

>Son I'm so sorry to be a pain in the ass but I need more stain mixed.

>Did you go to Paint Shop

>Yeah and they weren't worth nothing yadda yadda yadda

Guy then points at a reddish brown and wants 2 cans of it. I proceed to be an outright dick to him.

>Do you want a red deck?

>No

>Well that color is red so don't get it

(In my defense, this color always comes out way red)

>Well it looks alright in this book

Note that the samples in our books are garbage.

>Well you're gonna hate it, that's not a dark brown. That's what you're wanting ain't it?

I point at our dark browns

>Well that's almost black!

>That's our only options

I proceed to spend almost a whole hour dealing with him AGAIN. He finally picks out a medium brown. I help with another order for maybe 5 minutes, come back to him and double check on the color. He's sure.

>Alright I'll just make a quart first just to make sure you like it!

>OH NONONONO I don't want y'all to have to waste stain for me!

>Oh no sir it's quite alright!

I make it, and what do you know he hates it. I tell him take it home and try it on his deck to make sure. I tell him it's $20 and he freaks out saying he ain't paying that to test and to make him 2 gallons-despite hating said color. I grab my coworker, explain what's going on, and tell him I'm sorry, but I'm done with the guy, and if he approaches you good luck.

Another hour passes, I'm putting up stock, and my coworker sends him on his merry way, or so we hoped. He takes the 2 cans (This'll make 6 cans we've wasted on him) up to the register to pay and throws a fit.

So we were having a sale going with that stain. The sale was a rebate, and oh boy he didn't like that. Even though we told him that nearly a dozen times. He comes back ranting and raving. He walks out the door once he's done, and then comes right back and returns it, SCREAMING at the poor cashier and waving his card right in her face demanding his money back. A random other coworker didn't know what was going on and just to shut him up (this was while the refund was happening) said he'd just have them take the rebate off the paint price since he ""didn't know."" He freaks out at that too,

>NO I WANT ALL MY DAMN MONEY ON MY DAMN CARD RIGHT NOW

So he gets his refund. Management at this point is sick of him, and tells me if he wants another paint mixed tell him no he's cut off. HELL YEAH.

So I get the stain back he just returned and mess the color up again. He comes storming over, picks up a 5 gallon of premixed stain, and leaves. He comes back not even a minute later and buys other random stuff like nothing happened.

It's 9:45. All our nights are ruined thanks to this one guy

**Part 3**

The guy comes in the following morning (I wasn't here for this) and I think at this point he knew the jig was up and wanting to throw a Hail Mary and see if he could pull off the scam. Oh and he returned his 5 gallon, claiming his ""painters didn't show up.""

He deals with my manager, and while he's thinking about a color my manager helps someone else, then comes back to the man, and it smells like he crapped his pants. And the guy just stood there like nothing happened. He talks to my manager for another 15-20 minutes, all the while the crap smell stuck around. He sends him to our nearby competition, and at last he leaves, defeated, dejected, and has yet to return. Later that day one of the higher ups tells us he's permanently cut off from getting paint mixed.

**Tl;dr** dude tries an obvious scam for 2 days, screws us out of nearly $300 of deck stain, and when he realizes the jig is up he screams at cashiers and craps his pants."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0gitc/youre_braindead/,"""You're braindead"" I'm so happy I found this subreddit because I have lots of rude customer stories that I can contribute but this one takes the cake. I was working at the tills at the clothing store I worked at when the most cliche Karen waddled up with two friends and dumped their clothes on the counter. While I was processing the sale Karen repeatedly kept making rude backhanded comments to me while her friends just stayed quiet, I decided to just ignore her and tried to finish the sale as quickly as possible. When I was done she leaves and I was thankful I didn't have to deal with her anymore. Or so I thought.

One month later...

I was on tills again and shouted ""NEXT"" after finishing a sale. Two women walk up to the counter and one scoffs and says in a mocking tone ""It's next PLEASE!"". That's when I recognized her, the rude, self-entitled Karen that I had to deal with last month. I just stayed quiet and started processing the sale. Again I had to put up with her rude, backhanded comments and remarks throughout the whole sale. I thought it couldn't get much worse but boy was I wrong. When it was time to pay she hands me a one4all card (this is a gift card that is valid in most stores in my country. I scan it and it came up insufficient funds and my face drops because I know she is going to shoot the messenger.

Me: ""There are not enough funds on the card to make the transaction.""

Karen: sigh ""Well how much is on it?""

Me: ""I don't know it just says that there's not enough, it doesn't say an amount.""

Karen puts on a tone that makes it sound like she was talking to a five-year-old.

Karen: ""Well can't you check?!!""

Me: ""No sorry, we can't do that here, you'll have to check on the website.""

Karen: scoffs ""This is ridiculous. Fine, never mind, I'll pay by cash.""

She snatches the gift card from my hand and takes out her purse and turns it upside down and a stream of change and notes spill all across the counter. She then gives me a look that says ""What are you waiting for?"" I was tired from my long shift and Karen was making me stressed so I wasn't really thinking, I just wanted the sale to be over, so I took a note and opened the till, the entire time Karen is watching me like a hawk, looking from me to the money in my hand and back up at me. I take out the change and try to hand it to Karen. She looks at my hand in disgust.

Karen: ""What the hell is that?""

Me: ""Um... your change.""

Karen: ""Yeah exactly, why do I have change, couldn't you have just counted out the exact amount from this.""

She gestures at the hundreds of coins on the counter.

Me: ""Oh sorry, I didn't think-""

Karen: ""Yeah exactly, you didn't think.""

Normally when something like this happens we are supposed to just get the supervisor to open the till and redo the cash part of the transaction and it would be an easy fix to the problem but I wasn't about to do her any favors. I started to wonder why she never said anything when I picked up the note in the first place because she very clearly saw me, but then I realized that she wanted me to make this mistake. She wanted me to make this mistake so she could treat me like shit and justify it in her delusional mind.

Me: ""Well you were watching me process the sale and you never said anything.""

Karen looks shocked I would dare talk back to her.

Karen: ""I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO TELL YOU, YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN!!!""

I go quite, I knew if I said anything I would make things worse and I hoped that now she had her change she would just leave. But I had no such luck.

Karen: ""Ugh, your braindead.""

Both me and the friend she had with her was shocked. She had been incredibly rude to me up to this point but this was the first time she had blatantly insulted me. She starts repeating this insult at me over and over.

Karen: ""You're so braindead.""

She turns to her friend and says ""He's braindead isn't he"" but the friend just stayed quiet and gives her a look that seemed to say ""Don't drag me into this."" To be honest I think her friend felt bad for me. I was pissed off, I sat there debating whether or not it would be worth it if I gave her a taste of her own medicine, but in the end, I decided she wasn't worth it, this was my very first job and I didn't want to get fired from it. She started clearing the change off the counter into her purse, and while she did it she continued to mutter about how braindead I was. When she was finished she grabbed her shopping and stormed off and I haven't seen her since."

There was an elderly customer who could not find a salesperson in the area she was shopping, she even saw one of our phones with the number for security displayed on it and tried calling them to no avail. 

Instead of going to the upper level to look for a salesperson there, she spotted a camera, started waving the merchandise she wished to purchase above her head, and walked out into the mall. 

She walked through the mall and into our other store where she found my counter and told me about all of it. Purchased her merchandise that she ""stole.""

So a few years back I had a seasonal job with a store.  I had been told I was going to be hired on permanently, but they gave me some excuse as to why I wasn't able to be hired two days before my seasonal job ended.  I was disappointed because I loved this job, but I figured I'd be eligible for rehire so it wasn't too bad. Looking back, I corrected the assistant manager twice (price check on seasonal clearance, backed up by the GM, I was legit right) and then suddenly wasn't going to be permanent so I know why it happened.

So I show up for my last shift, even though I was screwed over, because I'm a nice person and didn't want to leave them short handed.  I was put on the register for my last shift and had to call with increasing frequency for back up on registers because of increase in customers.  Every single time I do, the assistant manager and her little lackey (we'll call them A and B) get on the radio and passive aggressively talk to each other about how I'm calling for backup AGAIN and they sure hope I don't take up too much of their time because they have SO MUCH to get done that day.  I let it slide off me because it was my last shift and I'll be damned if I let these two push me into walking out.  Still, it was highly annoying.  

Finally, with maybe an hour left in my shift, a lady came up and was buying about $30 worth of stuff.  She said she had a $20 bill and hadn't been able to get to the coin counting machines to get her change taken care of and would I mind counting out the rest in change?  Now, I'd just listened to yet another rendition from A and B about how much of an inconvenience it was to have to come help me and they needed to be able to finish their tasks that the GM assigned them, blah blah blah. I looked at my customer and said, ""Ma'am, why don't we count out all the change first and then take the rest out of the $20? Those change machines take a percentage and we're always happy to have change!"" It took me twenty minutes to count it all out. There was only about $6 in quarters and maybe another $5 in dimes, but I kept going until I used up as much of her change as possible. Every one of the coin spots was full to the top, plus a bunch extra tossed haphazardly in the extra spot off to the side.  B couldn't leave the other register the entire time because of customers and I got to out do them in passive aggressiveness right before leaving.  Left that place with a poo-eating grin and I've never gone back.  

tl:dr- coworkers want to be petty and try to make me feel bad, I do my job AND screw them over simultaneously."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d01vhf/1_is_too_expensive/,"""$1 is too expensive."" I recently got a new job at my local Five Below, after being laid off from my job at a plant nursery. Everything in the store is 5 or less, so we actually get a lot of people come in for back to school shopping, hoping to save money. 

I'm on mobile, sorry for spacing.

This was probably my second day, and my first late shift, so I was a little nervous but determined to do well. I was the only cashier at the register because the manager was restocking items. Eventually, I one woman approaches my register and I smile and give my usual greeting.

Me: Hello ma'am! Are you ready to check out?

C: Yes, but I have one question.

Me: Of course, go ahead.

C: Are these really a dollar a piece?

She was talking about a large stack of folders she brought to the register. I checked them in the computer first, really not wanting to mess up when I was still new, and saw that it was the correct price.

Me: Yes Ma'am, those are each one dollar.

She smiles, so I went back to ringing up her items, thinking all was well.

C: That is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.

I was sort of taken aback by the way she said it, but I could kind of understand what she was talking about. She had a lot of them, so it added up to a bit of a high price, plus she had other things to check out as well. But the folders she was buying were the kind that were made to last. If she was buying those cheap plastic ones (which cost 25 cents) I would understand a dollar being ridiculously expensive.

Of course I wasn't going to SAY any of that. I just stopped smiling, put my head down and continued to ring up her items. I gave her the total, she paid and walked out. Nothing dramatic (thankfully, as I want to keep this job) but it did put a damper on my mood that day. I always feel bad when a customer complains about something, but I don't know what she wanted me to do. Agree with her?"

In my pre-university days back in the early 90s I worked weekends at a small supermarket whose name rhymed with Late Rose. I had many odd encounters while there (with both customers and my often 'eccentric' colleagues).


One sunny Saturday, a well-heeled gent approached me.


WHG: Excuse me. Where would I find the Tusko (our only local rival supermarket) crisps?


Me: Um... In Tusko, Sir.


WHG: What?? Haven't you got any in stock?


Me: I'm afraid not, Sir. The only place you can get Tusko own brand crisps is... well... Tusko.


WHG: (getting a tad fractious): That's utter rubbish. You can get them anywhere! And if you don't sell them, you should. They're far better than your own brand crisps (SPOILER they were the same crisps in different bags but you don't tell customers that).


Me: I assure you, Sir, shops' own brand crisps or, indeed, any own brand goods are only ever sold in those actual shops. 


WHG: (leans up close to my face and stage whispers) You just don't want a rival making a profit in your shop. It's PATHETIC and that's why Tusko will put you out of business: if you don't start selling Tusko products, everyone will go to Tusko to get them. Then you'll be sorry! 


With that he stood back, grabbed a multipack of Late Rose crisps, made a strange attempt at a smug face (or he might have had trapped wind) and strode off, presumably in search of some Saintsberrys digestives. 


I just shook my head and went back to pricing some tins with my pricing gun which I was ACE at. I was quite upset when sticky price labels went the way of the dinosaur."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0bo7k/how_dare_you_care_about_the_safety_of_customers/,"How dare you care about the safety of customers! So I work at a store that sells, buys, trades and repairs arcade machines. We also deal in pool tables and such.

One day, I notice that a cocktail style arcade machine, has the door covering the electronics missing, while the machine was on the sales floor. Well, that kind of looks a bit dumpy to have that where customers can see it, with no one actively working on it or signs of work-in-progress (like a tool box or manual near it). But it gets even better. The missing door, was right where a player's knees would be, if sitting in front of the game to play it. The high voltage parts of the machine were exposed, and it was *plugged in while the store was open*.

This really looked like a recipe for disaster, doubly so since we get children in the store at times, so I went over and was about to unplug the machine. Of the two coworkers present at the time, they both flipped out when they saw what I was going to do, both of whom insisted ""It's fine"" and actually sounded angry at me. Okay, whatever. So, instead I opt to move the machine in such a way that the opening is more obstructed. But no, it absolutely *had* to be facing *that* direction, and *had* to stay plugged in. One of the guys was about to go build a new cover for it in the back, but why couldn't he just tell me that in the first place?

One of those people pulled a similarly boneheaded move, basically bypassing a main fuse to try and get a machine running. (the fuse holder was broken and it wasn't a type that is very common, but surely a substitute could be wired in so that there would still be protection?) For those who didn't study electronics, the whole point of a fuse is so that a fire doesn't start if there's a fault in a circuit (or in this case, the skee-ball machine) so wiring around it is a good way to burn down the building.

I had a rather strongly worded conversation with him about how dangerous that is, and also the lesser possibility of simply rendering the machine a total loss, which would still be a good way for him to lose his job. I also suggested that he at least know where the fire extinguisher is, since anyone willing to pull a stunt like that will probably end up needing it. That, or maybe just a good pair of running shoes.

I didn't tell my boss about that thing with the fuse, since I figured maybe the employee could learn from this, and I thought that might be a 0-tolerance instant dismissal for that guy if the boss found out, and maybe I could also play the ""I didn't tell the boss about (thing that would have cost you your job)"" card to get him to listen if I need to steer him away from other stupidity. However, I do intend to tell my boss how two different people both got mad at me, for unplugging things that might electrocute someone."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/d0bibs/ah_memories/,"Ah, memories... Hey there everyone, this is not only my first post to this sub, but I'm also on mobile! So, ah... Please bear with me here! 

So, last year I got hired at a popular retailer and began training as a standard brand associate, later to be a cashier. I've got a lot of fun stories from my days as a trainie and before getting my leadership position, but I think it's appropriate to start with my first funny experience as a cashier. Mind you, this was as I was being trained on cashwrap, and that this is my first job-- I was so confused xD (Note: I find this funny, because of how awkward it was.)

So, let's cut to the chase! 

Some time in July, 2018....
There I was, getting some live training in on one of our less busy days during back to school season. I was at a point where I didn't have a customer in line, and was next to a colleague in case I have any questions. Well, the phone began to ring, and a customer was in the line with a rather large transaction ahead-- I was instructed to answer the phone. (I am me, the caller is C)

I was not trained for this!

Me: ""Hello, thank you for calling companyname, this is me.""

C: ""Hellooo.""

*A second of awkward silence.*

C: ""Right, ah. So.. This is a bit of an embarrassing question.""

Me, immediately concerned about what was about to be asked: ""Hm?""

C: ""Does your companyname location have... uh. Those.. Plastic... Nipple covers?""

Okay, I'll be honest, I was oblivious to what she was trying to describe. Like, I've been to Vegas before, I've seen what she's describing, but that didn't come to mind.

Me: ""Uhm.. One second, lemme ask."" I put her on hold, and walked up to my colleague, who was still helping the customer with the large transaction (It was like.. ~$250 in jeans so far). ""So, Co-worker, the customer on the line wants to know if we have..."" I had to take a minute to recall her description. ""..Plastic.. uh. Covers."" 

CW: ""..Huh?""

Me: ""Plastic... Nipple covers?""

CW, trying not to laugh as the customer did: ""No, we don't carry pasties.""

Me, probably red-faced because I just said nipple at my new workplace: ""Okaythanks!"" I spoke quickly to get OUT of the situation. I picked up the phone.

""Ah, yes. Thank you for holding, ma'am. No, we do not carry those.""

C: ""Okay, thank you."" Click.

Guys I was so nervous to answer the phone from that point forward, now I just call for a stock check on line one instead of checking myself. Looking back on it, I really question how I didn't know what the heck a pastie was. And yes, my co-worker and I had a laugh about it afterwards. I'll never live that down. What makes it better is how she's old enough for me to be her son. 

Whelp, that's the end of my first tale. Many more to come if y'all are interested!"

C- customer 
E- co-worker
 
Now, C comes in and presents a rain check to E. She comes over to me (in the back on a break) and says that she brought it in and it's well past expired what should she do.  Our manager is on vacation so she doesn't want to call and bother her and ask if she should accept it anyways so I tell her it's expired so she should not give her the sale but she can override it if she wants to. I come out with her at this point. 

E- okay so this offer is expired but I will give it to you this time.

E- i understand, that's why i-

E- she is not here

C- who is in the back?

E- no one 

C- this is ridiculous I'll be calling customer service I shouldn't be punished because no one called me to tell me it's in! 

At this point she is drawing attention from other customers and she storms off. As she is walking out E shouts ""HAVE A NICE DAY!"" She is quite a loud and outspoken person so it had a bit of 'tude to it but it was nice for her. 

THIS WOMAM COMES BACK IN THE STORE just to reiterate that she will be contacting our superiors. E just said okay and we all had a giggle about it later cuz like.. We were going to give her the sale price. Some people are just crazy I guess!

UPDATE: she came back in and was talking to another co-worker that she is apparently all buddy buddy with saying she was terrorized by an employee. She said she was treated like a common criminal because she wanted this product and that she was ostrisized in front of a store full of people. She tells my co-worker that the employee was very rude and needs to be fired and that we were laughing at her. Then she says she walked out because ""I didn't want it anymore if she was gonna treat me like a criminal"" 
here is what SHE said happened (from what I could eavesdrop) 

C- I have a raincheck and no one has called me

E- sorry this is expired but I'll give it to you this time 

C- well no one called me so it's not my fault I shouldn't be punished

*walks out*
*walks back in*

E- change your mind?

C- no I just wanted to say you are very rude

E- *laughs in her face*

And during this my co-worker is all like ""Oh my gosh that's terrible I'm so sorry"" ect ect.

I’m training a new cashier and she’s, well, not the brightest. 
I have to show her how to do all of her cashiering duties each shift we work together, it’s like she comes back each day with no memory of working the days and now weeks prior. 

But this question just blew me away. 

Our freight day is generally the same as any typical retail store. A truck comes in early in the morning, delivers hundreds of totes of our products, and we stock them. 
Simple? Well, I guess after this it’s not. Haha

So I am training her (again) on how to use the scanner to show where product locations and positions are and she holds her hand up to ask a question. 
I pause and she simply asks “so this stuff is just what’s left at the register that customers didn’t want?”
I really had to pause and take a deep breath to not laugh out loud. 
Mind you as she asks this as one of the other cashiers is bringing up 8 totes, from the back, off the truck she saw earlier. 
To add to the 20 stacked around us in different aisles. 
I was perfectly pleasant (using my “nice” voice as my kids call it) and simply said
 “no, this is our order from the warehouse for the week, every week we restock the shelves based off what was purchased previously.”

It’s mind boggling the things she just does not notice. This may sound mean, or harsh, but trust me there are so many other bizarre questions coming from this lady daily. It’s really taken, and taught me, more patience. 

Makes you wonder how she’s made it through 50+ years of life though."

C, irritated,- ""No, this guy is lying to me that you all ran out of mac and cheese.""

CW 1- ""I'm sorry sir, but OP is not lying, I sold the last of it less than five minutes ago.""

C- ""This is the worst service I've had since coming back from Vietnam, go get me your manager, you two are going to be in a lot of trouble.""

Since it was around 7pm and our managers generally only work in the morning, no manager was in the store.

CW 1, whispering,- ""OP, go get CW 2, and explain what is happening, he has the most seniority.""

I went and got CW 2 and explained and he said that he would defuse the situation

CW 2- ""Hello sir, what was the issue?""

C- ""Yes, these two are lying to me about not having mac and cheese.""

CW 2- ""Sir they are out but is there something I could give you discounted to make up for the trouble?""

C- ""I guess I'll take some fried chicken, and making sure the two working here are punished.""

CW 2 is a really nice old man so he says ""I'll have a chat with them after you are out of here.""

After the man leaves we all just have a laugh in the kitchen.

The customer got some discounted fried chicken and when he came back he bought half of the macaroni that just came out. I know it's not the shortest or most interesting story.

Thanks for sticking around, if you see any grammar issues feel free to let me know so I know where I can improve upon if I ever need to post again.

TL;DR man gets mad of lack of mac and cheese, tries and gets my co-worker and I in trouble."

We sell bags for 10¢, and have boxes if you forget to bring reusable bags. Some people being in extra plastic bags they've stashed at home, and give them to us to disperse. Everything here is insanely cheap. Full cart of groceries for $30, cheap. 

We got absolutely slammed after the holiday weekend, as we expected. It got so busy that we ran out of extra bags AND boxes, which usually doesn't happen. 

I had an entire family over 250lbs each, all adults. They stank. They were mean.

It came time to pay and pack their items, but when I mentioned that we ran out of free bags and boxes, but have 10¢ bags available, the lady who did all the talking got pissed. ""I'll see about that!"" as she stormed off to ask stockers. 

In the meantime, one of the guys with her just asked for a few of the 10¢ bags and we packed up. She came back, rammed into my regular, and started barking at the guy who got the bags. She complained about how long the wait was (it's not, at all, she just took forever). 

My regular went ""those people are rude"" as I rang her up. I smiled real big said ""have a nice day!"" She knew they ticked me off, too, and said ""good luck!""

Then they called her a bitch. Nice. 

I turned back around to see all the dog food I was pricing, in their cart. ""Hey you didn't pay for that"". ""Oh. Thought we did."" as they reluctantly have it back. 

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here, but they didn't even stop by the pet section. No way they thought they had paid for it. 

I'll have a good rant with my customer next week."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/czt082/you_cant_shop_at_our_store_if_youre_banned/,"You can't shop at our store if you're banned So I work at a large supercenter, which is part of a chain, and we do many online orders for customers. 

When we look up there name it tells us of the order is on it's way, ready to be picked, or if it was dispensed. I'm still fairly new to this area and usually need help if there is a big problem. 

Yesterday, these two women came in and said they were there to pick up an order.

Me: ""Who are you picking up for?""

Girl: ""Jane Smith""

Me: ""I'm sorry, I don't see an order under that name, is it under a different name?""

G: ""Maybe Lisa Smith?""

M: ""Are you sure it's at our store and not one in the town over?""

Other woman: ""It should be at this store, they live in this town. It better not be there. I don't want to drive there.""

I tried that name too and nothing was showing up. The other woman started to get irritated and said that the same they had problems last time too.

M: ""Do you have the order number? Or the conformation email?""

Other woman: ""No. Her mother ordered it, she has gotten multiple emails saying it's here and it wasn't last time.""

I apologized to her around the same time my coworker came over and gave her a number to call customer service. 

Then earlier today I got a phone call from the woman who ordered.

JS: ""I wanna know if my order is there. I keep getting emails and when they go to pick it up, it's not there.""

M: ""Okay I'm going to put you on hold and see if I can find someone to help.""

Less than five minutes later she told my coworker it wasn't a good time to talk because she was about to see her son, who is in rehab.

Then, she calls back a while later. 

M: ""Okay, do you have your order number?""

JS: ""No. My phone is locked up and I can't get into it. It's there, I send my daughter it pick up stuff from there because I'm not allowed there.""

M: ""Could it be at a different store?"" 

JS: ""No I live here.""

M: ""Okay let me go look my the computer and see what I can figure out.""

A different coworker and I look up her name and see her order history through our store. All of her items had went to a store in the other town. Just like they did the month before.

She's banned from entering our store and she kept ordering items, in her name, but thought because someone else was actually picking it up it would be okay. The system auto kicks her to the closest store.

M: ""So it looks like your stuff is actually at the other store.""

JS: ""Ugh this is ridiculous. Your store keeps messing this up, I'm so pissed. I want a number to call someone, I want to speak to who is in charge of this.""

I gave her the customer service number and thanked god that I finally got to hang up.

Tl;dr:  Woman keeps ordering items to our store, even though she's banned from entering, and gets mad when her items are sent to a different location."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/czxn1i/confused_callers/,"Confused callers Posting from mobile, first post, you know the deal. On to the story!

For context, I work for a small scale warehouse style retail store that is similarly named to our competitor. People sometimes mix us up, as to be expected. Due to the similar naming, I get calls like this: 

*phone rings*
Me: Thank you for calling ""store name"", this is ""me"", how can I help you?
Customer: Is this the store on ""not our address""?
Me: No, I'm sorry. We don't have a location at that address. I think its a possibility you may have meant to call our competitor store?
C: That's not possible! Isn't this ""competitor name""!?!
Me: Unfortunately it is not, this is ""store name"", I know its quite familiar to the other store, but we are entirely separate companies.
C: So you're not ""competitor store""?
Me: No, we're not. 
C: Are you sure? Didn't you used to be one?!?
Me: No, I'm sorry. Again we're entirely separate stores, unfortunate similar names, but they're actually our competitor.
C: That's just weird, I thought you were all the same....are you sure?
Me: Yes I'm sure.
C: Fine, can you give me their phone number?
Me: I'm sorry, unfortunately I dont have their phone number.
C: THAT'S JUST RIDICULOUS! *HANGS UP*
Me: *yells at phone* Why would I give you my competitors number?!?!

I mean a quick Google search clearly shows that they're two separate companies, with different (although similar) names! Yet this happens ALL the time. Reading is really hard I guess.. 

Side note, I've heard through the grapevine from our vendors that the other store gets equally as irritated with confised callers and customers. So it's atleast not one sided!"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/czup1n/old_couple_blames_me_for_them_not_knowing_they/,"Old Couple Blames Me For Them Not Knowing They Had An Account With The Store. Over the summer of 2019, I worked as a sales associate for a store that was due to close in a few months. Liquidation brought out the worst of the worst in my town it seemed because of the crazy sales we had, so I dealt with more rude customers than usual. I'll probably post more of the stories later after this one. 

One of my friends had recently gotten a job working as a sales associate with me, so I was training her on the registers and how to navigate customer accounts. It was the end of the day and I had been having my friend using my associate ID to use the register all day, but I decided to take over for her since I was faster and had her cleaning the cash wrap while I finished up the line. An older couple got to the register and everything was going okay. Granted, it was late and I was exhausted, so I wasn't exactly going through all the things I usually say. Usually after scanning everything, we asked the customers if they had any points they'd like to use and then either ask them to type in their phone number or we ask for it and type it in ourselves depending on what point of the transaction we were on. I didn't ask those questions, but the husband asked, ""Do I have to enter in my phone number?"" 

I replied with, ""No, not unless you have an account with us that you want to use."" He said, ""Ah okay no."" which then prompted me to skip past the part where I'd have to enter in their number. I considered this as my excuse to not say anything else about it considering the customer just said they don't have an account. I ring them up, they pay, I give them their receipt, and they walked off to the side. I began to ring up the next and last customer in my line for the day and notice the old couple standing there with their receipt in hand looking confused. They try to come to me for questions, but I'm busy with a massive load of clothes from my last customer and ask my friend, who has finished cleaning at this point, to help the couple while I finish up. 

I look over after I get finished with the last customer to see the couple and my friend staring at the receipt in confusion. I walk over to help because my friend doesn't do well with confrontation, and figured watching me would help her, and they ask me where on the receipt it shows how many points they have. I told them that points are connected to accounts, and that because they didn't have a number put in, they never accessed an account and therefore never got points on the purchase. The husband complains saying, ""I didn't know we had an account. I've always just put my number in and gotten points."" 

I replied with, ""If a number gets you points, that means you have an account.  You said you didn't have an account so a number was never put in."" The husband then asked me to refund the sale so they could redo it. I tell them I can't. Because the store was going through liquidation, we weren't allowed to do refunds or do exchanges. All sales were final, no exceptions. This was my first job, and I wasn't about to risk it due to the incredibly strict liquidator who was in charge of everything at this point. The couple gets irritated with me and asks for my manager. Once this happens, I reach for the phone and ignore the couple while I call for a manager over the intercoms. My manager comes over and I begin to tell her what happened, trying to be as polite as I could be. 

I begin by saying, ""This customer is complaining about not having any points from this purchase. They said they didn't have an account-""

The man cuts me off rudely and says, ""Now I never said that! Don't go putting words in my mouth, girl!"" 

I have a bad temper, so this makes my blood boil. I'm a college student. Not some child. I do not take well to being disrespected like that. I laughed and smiled, but keep quiet as to not get myself into any trouble. My manager jumped in and began leading the conversation. She told them that there's nothing on our end we can do, but gave them online information that would allow them to log into their account, type in the number on their receipt, and get the points from the purchase. they complain about me, and my manager says, ""She's new. She doesn't have it all figured out yet."" I'm a quick learner (hence why I was actually training people as well) and my manager understood that, so this was just a way to get the customer to lay off of me for their incompetence.  They go on a tangent about how horrible service is why we were going out of business (not true) and that they'd never do business with the store again. Somewhere in this rant the woman speaks about how ""corrupt the company is"" and how we're ""just out to steal more money from customers."" Not the case, but my manager and I just let them go on. My manager apologized again and made sure they had the information they needed before asking them to leave. I smiled at them and said, ""Have a good night!"" Once they left, my manager told me to not worry about what just happened. It wasn't my fault they didn't know they had an account with us. She tells us to start closing our registers. 

I turn to my friend who looked stressed out for me. She thanked me for dealing with the customers because she would have freaked out. I shrugged it off. I'd rather throw myself at rude customers than let my friend have to deal with them."

It was around may so we were selling peonies.
We put them in a bucket for people to choose the ones they liked best, so that they could bring them to me, I would count the stems and give them the price for the flowers.

A lady comes up to me with three of them in hand and asks me:

L: Is the price per stem or bud?

Me: It's 50 ct per stem.

L: This one has two buds while the others have just one. They should be cheaper.

Me: I'm sorry, price is per stem.

L: But they are worth less, because they only have one bud each.

Me: Look at it that way: The ones with only one bud are 50 ct, but the one with two buds is still only 50 ct. So you'll effectively get that one for cheaper.

L: No, I don't want to pay that much for something so puny.

Me: I'm sorry, but the price is set. Maybe you can find another one with more than one bud?

She then shoved them at me while saying ""goodbye"" with a hateful look in her eyes.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/czq7yr/hey_i_dont_have_to_help_you/,"Hey, I don't have to help you. In past posts I've blamed my behavior on the hot weather, or workload, or lack of sleep, but today I don't have any of those excuses. I might have a serious mental problem. 

I'm working in the back as usual, pretty chill day and stuff is going well, when they call from the front of the store to have me go out and pump propane. Pretty rare that they ask lately, guess they must be slammed up there.

On my way out I see a dirty white pickup truck with a couple guys hanging out, but they're not at the propane pump so I ignore them. Still, there's this funny little twist in my gut... I can't tell you what it is but there's something about that truck that spells trouble. Just a regular couple of guys in work clothes chatting but... I don't know. I make a mental note to ask about them later.

At the pump is a nice lady in a knee brace and an older fella waiting with BBQ tanks. Dude says ""ladies first"" in that casual old-world  it-would-be-embarassing-not-to kind of way. Okay my dude, respect. 

I take a picture of the date on the tank (procedures, I won't bore you with why we do that) and fill it up for Knee Brace. She takes it away, I upload the numbers to the store so she can go in and pay, and reset the pump.

Here's where things get interesting. 

As I walk over to Old Dude's tank I see one of the pickup guys approaching with his own tank, one of the big industrial ones. Okay, whatever. I crouch down to take a picture of the BBQ tank and Pickup says: ""Just the one.""

I look up and shake my head. ""Okay?""

For the record: I'm told that my emotions register very clearly on my face. I'm a terrible liar and avoid poker.

So at this point I've given him a clear ""can't you see I'm busy"" look... And really that should be it. But it isn't. 

I find the date on the BBQ tank and take the picture. As I stand Pickup pipes up: ""Hey, I was here first! I've been waiting!""

I barely glance in his direction: ""When I walked up I saw two people standing at the pump, so that's who I'm helping.""

""I've been waiting 25 minutes! Come on now this is ridiculous!""

Okay... lemme process this.

1. Somehow 25 minutes went by before anyone let me know about propane. Bullsh!t.

2. You're a big guy who's clearly in shape, but you expected your place in line to be held while you lounge in your truck because standing is too much for you.

3. You actually want to butt in line in front of a sweet old man.

But I couldn't even get mad. It was like watching a clown. A bemused smile creeps across my face as I beheld the man-child.

I mulled over what to do, seeing as how I didn't want Old Dude to feel uncomfortable, but then he said: ""Well I've been waiting too and I went inside to get someone for propane.""

If Old Dude wants to stand his ground that's good enough for me. Pickup starts up with ""No I've been here..."" but I cut him off: ""I'll be with you in a minute."" I grab the BBQ tank.

Pickup loses his mind. ""This is unbelievable. I've been waiting this whole time and now you're just gonna let...""

I shrug, make eye contact, and shoot him a grin: ""Hey, I don't have to fill your tank.""

I try not to laugh as I let him rant for 15-20 more seconds before I realize he's wasting Old Dude's time, which is not okay. I put up a hand and say in my best go-sit-in-the-corner voice: ""Hey, I'm going to fill this now. Take a breath!""

He stomps off to his truck in impotent rage as I fill Old Dude's tank and we chat. It only takes a few seconds, which is too bad because he seems like a nice guy. Big family get together this weekend, daughter's coming in from out of town with the grandkids and everything. 

I wish him well, upload his numbers to the store so he can pay, and reset the pump. I grab the big tank and Pickup starts coming over for round 2, but something about the way I look at him stops him half way. He decides to continue his whining from a safe distance. 

At this point I want to take a second and go back to the concerns I raised at the top of this post. 

Because I didn't shoot him a look of warning or some kind of angry expression. I wasn't mad, or worried about the fact that the guy was bit taller than me and looked like he could handle himself, or even vaguely interested in customer service BS. None of that was even on the radar.

If anything I was just... Amused. A grown man acting this way. It was just kinda funny.

He tries to paint the picture of just how horrifyingly tragic it is that I've made him wait, spitting and getting all red faced as his shouts echo around the lot. I give him enough time to fail to make a point before enough of my amusement turns to disgust and I cut him off: ""Hey, do you want me to fill this tank or not?""

He reels a bit but comes back for round 3: ""I'm working over at the other store fixing the roof you know!""

""... and?""

""Well who do I have to talk to about this...""

Bored now. I turn around and switch on the pump. He keeps ranting. I ignore him - I can't hear him over the noise of the pump from all the way over there anyway. 

When I switch it off he's still going. I give him a surprised look and say: ""Sorry, what was that?""

He looks like he wants to kill me but at this point it is super hard for me not to laugh. I do notice he isn't closing the distance between us yet. Good boy.

""I'm going to put in a complaint about you!""

""Oh, please do,"" I say with a sincere and hopeful smile.

""Well here I am waiting all this time while you play on your phone...""

I laugh. ""Oh, is that what I'm doing?""

And again, what is wrong with me? I used to be so scared of confrontation or getting in trouble but I sincerely, deeply, wholeheartedly could not give a fk about this whining roofer.

I upload the numbers. He continues to try idle threats but I'm too bored to pay attention and leave. He waits until I'm far enough away before he grabs the tank. 

Manager later confirms he's super annoying when he goes in to pay, having embellished his tale of woe to include the fact that he's on his lunch break. 

Hey. Don't annoy my manager. She works hard. 

I call over to the other store where he's doing the roofing. They hate that guy too, and promise us to have a talk to him about not wasting our time while on his lunch break."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/czayky/you_have_to_sell_it_to_me_for_that_price_its_the/,"""You have to sell it to me for *that* price! It's the law! I used to work as a cashier at a grocery store a long time ago.

At the front of the store, near the registers, we have stacks of bags of charcoal. There are a few different kinds, all clearly labeled. Two of the bags look rather similar, being the same colour, but still clearly different brands if you bother to read. These two are placed at opposite ends with two or three other brands in between them. They are Samurai (cheap brand, we'll say $10) and Shogun (expensive brand, we'll say $40).

Naturally, people will sometimes put something back in the wrong place after deciding they don't want it.

So, one fateful day, a middle-aged gentleman comes to my register (I'm not going to call him ""MAG"" because I think it's silly to abbreviate names like that in stories like these. No offense to those who do, I just don't see the point) with a shopping cart filled with your normal groceries, and as I'm scanning the items, he walks over to the charcoal pallets.

I see him walk over to the Samurai stack, and I notice that someone had placed a bag of Shogun on it. He scans the prices up on the wall and picks up the Shogun bag, since it was supposedly the cheapest one he saw.

I know what's going to happen, so I try to diffuse the situation before it even happens (naturally, you know I fail since you're reading this story).

""Sir, just so you know, that charcoal is Shogun; not Samurai from the stack where you found it. It's $40,"" I tell him.

He looks at the bag and then back up at the wall above the Samurai stack and sees the price.

""But it says $10 on the price label,"" he responds.

I point out, ""That's for the Samurai charcoal, it says so right above the price.""

""... but I got it from that stack,"" he said, pointing to the Samurai stack.

""I understand, but it's not the same brand. Another customer must have put it there when they decided they didn't want it.""

Now, I should say I have a small tic where I quickly turn my head to the side. Usually happens when I get stressed, and dealing with this guy was starting to get stressful. So my tic happens, and his eyes light up.

""Oh! Oh, I see,"" he feigns. He must think I'm mentally challenged because of my tic.

He continues, ""Well, champ, why don't you go ahead and scan it and we'll see what price comes up?"" with a stupid grin on his face, 1,000,000,000% sure it's going to scan at $10.

I scan it, and sure enough, $40.

""But the sign says $10!"" he whines.

I try to show him the Shogun stack, ""Sir, if you'd look over there, *that* is the brand that you have here; Shogun.""

He looks over and sees the Shogun stack. He looks back at the Samurai stack, the Shogun bag, and the prices of both brands. Something clicks. He doesn't say anything for a few moments, and I can hear him thinking.

""...Oh, so they're different. Well, you still have to sell me this one for $10, though.""

???

""I'm sorry, sir, I can't do that.""

""You have to; it's the law!"" he barks.

""I'm sorry, what law is that?"" I ask, slightly scared.

""It was mislabled, so you have to sell it to me for the lower price! It's false advertising otherwise!""

A guy from another lane shouts over, ""Dude, that's not what false advertising is. Someone just put the wrong bag on that stack, you idiot!""

Charcoal dude ignores him and says, ""Are you going to sell it to me for the lower price or do I have to talk to your manager?""

I'm just about done with this guy, so I shout back towards Customer Service, ""ID!"" (We need a Manager ID card to change prices. That's not why I called, though; it also brings a manager out to solve any issues.)

So one of the managers arrives and I explain what happened to her, with him trying to butt in every few seconds. I forgot exactly what he said, but he lied about some aspects, and the guy who was in the other lane was still there, so he came over and corroborated my version of events.

My manager said, ""I'm sorry, sir. The prices are clearly marked and this is clearly Shogun brand charcoal, which is $40. Samurai brand charcoal is $10. If you want charcoal for $10, your only option is the Samurai brand.""

The guy looked back the charcoal pallets and the Shogun bag he had.

""... BUT IT'S THE LAW! I'M SUPPOSED TO GET THE CHEAPER PRICE BY LAW! IT'S THE LAW!""

(You'd think he was a lawyer with how much he said the word ""law"")

He argued with my manager for a few more seconds, but she wouldn't budge. He eventually got fed up and stormed off without his groceries, yelling, ""THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW! FALSE ADVERTISING! IT'S AGAINST THE LAW! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" (Okay, he didn't really screech, but I'm taking artistic liberty)."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/czfrmk/empty_your_cart_does_not_mean_youre_a_thief/,"""Empty your cart"" does not mean ""You're a thief"" TL;DR: Defensive customer thought I suspected her of being a thief when I was just following an empty cart store policy.

Quick backstory on me: I work at a small mom and pop supermarket in a relatively small city. I started working there in 2010 as a bagger, but I switched over to the cashier position later down the line, which I actually enjoy more. And I've been doing so well at it that, since earlier this year, I was promoted to being a trainer.

The thing about us, though, is that even though everyone who works here is just the nicest bunch of folks you've ever met, we have certain policies that customers need to follow. For instance, and this is the one policy that's relevant to this post, customers need to completely empty their cart when going through the check-out line, including 24 packs of sodas, waters, beer, etc., but excluding large items like 3 or 5 gallon water jugs, since those can be rung up from our machines. To some, this sounds like a dumb policy, but we have our reasons. This policy is in order in case, at best, the customer forgets an item behind a soda pack, or at worst, a shoplifter is trying to sneak something out of the store.

In any case, here's the cast for today's story: Me, Defensive Customer (DC), Awesome Manager (AM), and Caring Service-desk girl (CS).

So today was day 2 of my new student's training session. Things are going pretty smoothly, she's getting used to the way things work, and some of the other check-out lines are open, including the one right next to us. Whenever I train someone, I usually hang out in the line space next to my student's register, which gives me time to not only help her, but help other customers who come through the next line and give them some assistance. Enter DC, who comes through the next-door line with her groceries including 4 packs of diet name-brand citrus soda. There's just one problem: only one of them is on the belt and three are still in the cart. So I politely empty her cart and the conversation goes something like this (note: most of this is paraphrased since I don't entirely remember what was said):

Me: Oh, I can get the rest of those up there for you.

DC: Can't she (the cashier waiting on her) just do a quantity scan from there?

Me: Unfortunately we have an empty cart store policy. Everything has to be out of the cart.

DC: This is BS! WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!

Me: I can call a manager for you, but he's going to tell you the same thing, that the cart needs to be empty.

DC: So are you saying that I'M A THIEF? I'M NOT A THIEF! I'VE NEVER STOLEN ANYTHING! (except I, at no point, said anything about her being a thief)

At this point, I'm pretty much done with her crap. When she started snapping at me like that, I called the general manager (AM) to the register at his convenience so that he could explain things to her. I told him exactly what happened, though it was hard for me to because I was stuttering through my words. Keep in mind, in the nine years I worked at this store, no one had ever snapped at me like that, so I really wasn't mentally prepared for something like this. DC tried to interject, saying that ""HE THOUGHT I WAS A THIEF, THEY ALL DID!"" (referring to the other employees present), but because I mentioned the empty cart policy, AM explained everything to the customer, and that seemed to quiet her down.

So once her order was complete, she left the store. And at this point, I'm visibly shaken, doing my damnedest to hold back tears from how frustrated and livid I was that I just had that encounter. One of the girls from the service desk (CS), came up and gave me a hug, which I was thankful for, and the owner of the store assured me that if DC called to complain to him about what had happened, she'd just be ignored. Just goes to show how great it is to work at a mom and pop store. If something happens to one of us, we'll step in and care for each other."

So yesterday, I get an order on the device for two sandwiches. One is normal. The other is our veggie option. But it's a strange one... all they've asked for is bread, with cheese, and two sauces. And that's it.

Usually, the whole point of ordering the veggie sandwich... is adding vegetables to it. 

But I think ""hey, well, if they have a problem with it, I'm sure they'll let us know.""  

Yep. 

Yes he did. 

Not 10 minutes after the delivery driver leaves, the phone rings. 

C - Customer. Me - me. 

Me: ""Hello, this is the sandwich shop""

C: ""Uh.... is this some kind of joke?""

Me, faux-confused: ""Huh?""

C: ""There's no salad in my sandwich. What the"" confused garbles and frustration. 

Okay. 

His tone of voice pissed me off. No ""hello, excuse me, but there's been a mistake"" or ""could I ask why my sandwich is weird"". Not polite, not nice. Just ""ISTHISSOMEKINDOFAJOKE"" like the typical male Karen I assumed he would be.

I get it. When I don't get what I ordered (or in this case what he presumed he ordered) I of course would phone and question it. But I try and be at least somewhat decent to a complete stranger just trying to do their job. This guy was not being a decent person. His tone of voice was condescending, and rude.

Customer service mode activated, but firm, I explain the mistake he made to him, and how I did, in fact, make what he ordered. 

C: ""But I swear I ordered salad.""

Me: ""Unfortunately no, you did not.""

I then read back his receipt, verbatim, and basically said ""sorry but it's your fault.""

He asked if he could get another sandwich. I told him to phone the delivery company or order again online. 

I told my manager. She told her manager. She then told myself and the other employees on a group chat that yeah, it was his fault, but her manager said to ""check if this happens in future, to call the customer.""

How about no. 

How about I make what you order. 

How about you use your eyes and your common sense when ordering online. 

I'm just glad I wasn't penalised for doing my job correctly. 

Check your food order before you confirm it. Don't be an idiot and order a ketchup and mayo cheese toastie by mistake. And if you do, do. Not. Blame. The. Employees. For doing their job, for creating your fuck up of an order. 

The man apparently phoned the company and asked for a refund, which my manager's manager refused. 

All in all, it was pretty funny."

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cz7p5q/he_demanded_a_return_on_a_500_purchase_that_hadnt/,"He demanded a return on a $500 purchase that hadn't been delivered yet This took place maybe two years ago.

We were having a normal day at the good ol' retail store when a customer comes in. He's on speaker phone with corporate and swearing up a storm about how he needed to return his online purchase of furniture. We have a system that allows us to cancel orders so long as they haven't been shipped. We can do returns on the orders as well if we get the items.

Of course corporate told him that we could make the return at the store. So the assistant manager checks their order number and finds out that the item has been shipped and is in process. More beautiful colorful language spills out of his crusty lips when she tells him that we can't do the return until he brings the item in. It's too far into the shipping process to change the shipping location. Our company uses a third party delivery system that isn't the three US name brand companies so we get little room to accommodate customers when it comes to shipping furniture.

But he still demands a refund and usually the manager can say no since in this situation there was nothing we could do until he had the item. She suggested he bring it in and return it once the item arrived but he refused. The idiot from corporate told my manager to do the return and they'd cancel the shipment somehow. We all knew that wasn't possible with our company and she told the person on the phone that, but they insisted, and the customer would not stop calling the manager a bitch.

He called the assistant manager more colorful language as he got his money back and left the store.

So that's a big hit for the store that day since the returns come out of our daily profits. It was basically a blank return since we had no item to take in for it.

A few weeks later he comes in screaming again. They delivered his furniture that he'd gotten a return on and he needed us to come get it from his house. Even though we knew that we had no way of arranging that, the Operations Manager spent about an hour on the phone with corporate trying to arrange a pick up. Corporate noped that up. If he wanted the furniture off his hands he'd have to bring it to the store himself, or ship it back at his expense.

None of us could figure out why he didn't just keep the furniture or sell it. No one was going to keep track of where it went off to at this point. The order had been canceled weeks ago according to corporate.

A few days later he came back, demanding during a store rush that someone help him bring the furniture inside. We were glad to do it and shocked that he actually brought it back.

Our operations manager decided to look in and figure out what happened with the order. The person from corporate on the phone with our assistant manager to begin with, marked the shipment as in progress and flipped the situation around so it looked like we refunded against store policy.

At this point it was basically free inventory. There was a whole lot of hassle on our end and the customers, to actually make that happen.

That company was something else.

I'm from Germany and english  is my second language. I'm writing on my phone, because it helps me to spell the word correctly.

Yesterday I had an insane old man as a customer. And this is how it went.

Me=me 

OD=old dude

My apprentice had send over to OD. Ge was sitting at one of our tables his rollater and his sunglasses in his hands.

Me: good day, my name is me,how may I help you. OD: I lost my glasses for long distance and need new one with the eyesight of my sunglasses.

Me: no problem, do you have your eyesight in writing? OD: no Me:Okay, had you ever bought glasses at our company? OD: mumbles something I can't understand.

I assume he doesn't know. So I take the tablet to check our database.

Me: what's your last name, please? OD: mumbles agai Me: sorry, could you please repeat that, I wasn't able to understand you properly because of the background noise. (It wasn't really loud, but OD was rude in his tone, from the beginning and I didn't want it to escalate.) OD(in a really rude tone): wy do you need it anyway. Me: I need it, to look you up in your database. OD: you can not find me there, I've never bought glasses here before.

Me: okay, then i need your sunglasses to check the eyesight of the lenses.

He doesn't react at all, but lets me take the sunglasses. I can see at first sight, that the glasses are not older than 2 years and that they are without powers.

I go and check anyway, to not upset him even more. While I'm on the way he shouts after me in an even ruder tone than before: I hope that I'll get them back. (Yes OD really accuses me of stealing his 2 year old sunglasses I an optician shop)

So I went to check the power of the lenses and as I thought, 0,0dpt in both lenses. No eyesight at all.

So I went back and tell him Me: sorry but there are no eyesight in your sunglasses.

And that is the point when it got ridiculous.

OD: your are lying. You just want to cover up your incompetence. These sunglasses where prescribed by a doctor. You're accusing the doctor of lying. Your company is crap anyway and I'll leave and never come back.

I was say nothing. Just stop up got to the door and opened it for him, while i was thinking: good, this way I don't have to kick him out.

On his way out he stopt at the table next to us and complained about something I couldn't understand. Then he went on his way out. I  the moment he got to the door he turned to me for one last time. OD: I hope your whole company has to close for good. You are the worst. Me: have a nice day.

My next customer was the one at tge table next to us and we had a little joke about OD"

So a little background im a manager at an Auto parts store. Our policy is take care of the customer no matter what. We offer online ordering. An order comes through for 1 quart of valvoline full synthetic 5w20 high mileage and a filter. A little weird but i shrug it off collect the order and stage it in the area assigned. About an hour later this customer comes in and my coworker collects his order. I dont hear any exchange but happen to be passing by and Customer says ""I want what i paid for"" naturally i stop in my tracks and see whats up.


C: I paid for 6 qts of oil thats what i want


Me: Sir this is what you paid for.


C: Shows me email receipt reflecting 1 qt of oil and 1 oil filter ""SEE!!!""


Me: Yes it says 1 qt and 1 filter. 1 qt is 10.49 plus tax and filter is x.xx youre total was xx.xx.


C: No look your website says 6 qts of oil for 10.49


Now the website says its 1 Quart Valvoline Full Synthetic 5w20 high Mileage Case of 6 for its description and i explained to him that simply meant a case was 6 quarts. He was having none of it and asked that question everyone asks ""Are you a manager""


Me: Yes sir I am the store manager you paid for 1 qt this is that quart.


C: ok i know what i have to do.


He walks away leaving his order on the counter and us like dude youre nuts if you think youre getting 6 qts of any oil for 10 dollars anywhere. After about 15 minutes he comes back to the counter and says we would hear from corporate and he would be back tomorrow for his oil.


I call my boss and our Customer Complaint Secretary and neither of them had heard the complaint at the time but my boss was adamant he would tell this guy hes nuts if it came back to him.


Cut to the next day he shows back up while im out smoking a cigarette. My coworker walks out and asks if im ready to deal with the D bag from yesterday. So i go inside and hes at the oil wall. I keep an eye on him just in case he wants to make a run for it. After about 5 minutes he comes to the counter. He has a 5 quart jug of the same oil and some fuel treatment. He paid with a gift card sent to his email with exactly 53 dollars on it. In the end he got what he wanted and all he had to do was call and complain that someone wouldnt give him 50 dollars in oil for 10 dollars."

As much as we're all loving getting the over time, it's taking a toll on our exhaustion levels. Throw in customers who don't care that we're doing what we can with what little staff we have, a new store manager, and staff getting grumpy with each other, things are getting kind of stressful. So it really made my week to witness this exchange between a cashier and a customer.

We keep certain things (perfume, electronics, flea medication) locked up in cases and on hooks that an employee has to come unlock then keep at a register until the customer is ready to check out completely.  

Customer: Ummm so can I please have the flea stuff

Cashier: Sorry but I have to keep this at my register until you're ready to check out. I'm at 14

Customer: Which one is that?

Cashier: (confused and probably as tired as I am)... it's the one that says 14 on it?

Customer: (raising voice and sounding annoyed) I know that! I'm not stupid! What's it by?

Cashier: (even more visibly confused) The one in between registers 13 and 15? I'll have my light on?

Customer: Keep the damn stuff I don't need to be treated like this! 

The customer stormed off and left her cart there full of stuff to be put away. Maybe it was a lack of sleep that made this whole thing hilarious to me but honestly I was just as confused as the cashier on how else to explain which register was 14."

A woman comes up to the registers with a massive, beautiful area rug that we just got in. It's been priced at $100-ish, which is high for our usual thrift store prices, but is still well below retail. She doesn't have the ""I want to speak to your manager"" haircut that I can tell, mostly because it's been tied up in a bun.

The woman scribbles down her name, number and a complaining message about how the rug was too expensive and how she wants to get a partial refund on this rug to reduce the cost down to $50, as well as a military discount on top of the price reduction. Then she pays for the rug and stomps out.

We posted the message on the store manager's office door, along with a note saying that I and my coworker told her multiple times that we don't haggle, OR give refunds.

Since I don't work on Tuesdays, I'm almost sorry I will have to wait to hear about the incoming Category 5 Tantrum that will likely ensue.

**Update:**

So Thursday was my first day back and I asked my store manager what happened. Events regaled to me as follows:

Store Manager came back to work to read the note. She proceeds to laugh and shake her head in disbelief at the audacity of this Entitled Lady before opening her office and starting up the daily stuff. She also checks the security feed for the day in question.

10am on the dot, when the store opens, the phone rings. Apparently, EL was not satisfied to simply leave a note and/or wait to be called back with an answer. Nope! She's on the phone with her spiel prepped and everything.

Store Manager politely listens to the whole song and dance. Amazingly the story remained consistent, with no added details, or claims that her son's cancer ridden puppy needs the money back for life saving miracle cures. Nope! She is literally admitting, again, that she has used the rug to hide damage to the house she showed early this morning and just wants her money back, or at least some of it.

>EL, winding down her story: ""...So that's why I'm hoping you can work with me on this.""  
>  
>Store Manager: ""Hmm. Well, actually, no, I can't.""

Beat of stunned silence.

>EL: ""I'm sorry, what do you mean you can't?""  
>  
>Store Manager: ""I can't. We don't do refunds at this store.""

(Rare occasions being an accidental overcharge, we CAN refund, but it's same day only, we don't advertise that we do it, and this lady doesn't need to know about rare exceptions because those only happen when WE are at fault.)

>EL: ""But the rug was too expensive!""  
>  
>Store Manager: ""And yet, you purchased the rug anyway, after being told that you would NOT be getting ANY money back.""  
>  
>EL: ""But nobody said that! Nobody told me that I couldn't return it, or get a price adjustment!""  
>  
>Store Manager: ""Ma'am, you WERE told that, multiple times.""  
>  
>EL, 0 - 100 instantly: ""ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?!""  
>  
>Store manager, calmly, ""Ma'am, we have video AND audio of the twenty minute long argument you had with both of my employees. They both very clearly inform you multiple times that we don't haggle and we don't refund.""

Crickets.

>Store Manager: ""Now, as I see it, you have a choice: either keep the rug, or donate it somewhere. Either way, we appreciate the money you have generously donated to all the homeless kitties and puppies at our local animal shelter. Have a nice day.""

Click.

I was honestly kind of speechless at the epic beauty of this complete shutdown of an EL. I don't know if my manager embellished on what she had said to this woman (as I am hearing it a couple of days after the fact) but I think I am going to pretend it's all true and hold that happy little thought in my heart for the rest of my days."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cz009x/maam_you_arent_listening/,"Ma'am, YOU Aren't Listening Sorry, this is my first post here and I am on mobile, so I apologize for any wonky formatting. However typos are my own doing, feel free to mercilessly point any out.

For background, I'm a manager at a dollar store. This happened today, a few hours prior, so it's been a holiday weekend and labor day was fairly busy.

My only coworker (CO) and I (ME) were both cleaning separate sections of the health aisle. I was organizing some pill boxes when an old lady (OL) approached me.

OL: ""Can you tell me where to find these for my shoes?"" Points to her feet.

Lucky for her, all the shoe insert and accessories were just to the right of the area I was organizing. I step over the area.

ME: ""You'll find all our shoe inserts right here.""

OL: ""No, you weren't listening to me. I need these."" She now waves both hands at her feet.

My coworker is within earshot and we share a look of ???.

ME: ""Ma'am if you need anything shoe insert related items are located here.""

OL: ""No, you aren't listening to me. I need these."" One more gesture to her feet. ""I need them to go on the inside.""

ME: ""Ma'am, everything we have related to shoe inserts will be here. Maybe it's one of these smaller packages here."" I gesture to smaller heel/ball inserts.

OL: ""NO, you aren't listening to me. I don't need shoe inserts. I need them for the front of my feet."" She touches the insert at the balls of her feet.

I'm lost, I have shown her the smaller partial cushions. Literally she touched the ball insert of sandals and I already pointed to those on our display. CO has walked to the end of the aisle, later she said she didn't know if she was going to laugh or tell OL off. I'm defeated. 

ME: ""Ma'am, if it's not there, then we don't sell them.""

I kid you not, just as I finish my sentence she grabs one of the smaller packages, that I POINTED to earlier. 

OL: ""No, it's right here. You should really learn the items you sell before saying something like that.""

I'm done. I don't understand her logic, but whatever she found it. May only the balls of her feet be cushioned while berates other employees. I turn back to organizing my pill shelf, quietly seething.

But she's not done. 

OL: ""Thanks for being useless with your help.""

I want so badly to say something witty or dry back to her, but I didn't really want to deal with her. I just met her gaze and simply said, ""OK."" in my customer service voice. 

I don't know what she was expecting, but apparently that wasn't it. Her face contorted as she thought of something to say, but I didn't give her much. She finally settles on looking offended that I wasn't insulted and huffs off.

CO warns me that OL asked for my name and is planning on complaining. CO had already said she would give her side of the story to the store manager. Texted my store manager a heads up and she already said ""Just because a customer complains, doesn't mean they're in the right.""

Literally my first thought after everything happened was posting here. Just had to vent before I hit the hay.

TL;DR Customer asks to me to find an item. As I point to it, she accuses of not listening, takes said item and believes she is the one who found it."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cz0ze0/customer_threatens_to_sue_me_because_his_warer/,"Customer Threatens to Sue Me Because His Warer Was Turned Off I used to work for a kitchen appliance repair company, I worked the phones answering calls, booking appointments, ect. The job was horrible, people are much more comfortable treating you poorly when they don't have to look you in the face.

Anyway, a little bit of information. Most appliance companies (Samsung, Whirlpool, Kitchenaid) have a one year warranty covering repairs, however this warranty is only valid so long as there's something actually wrong with the appliance itself since companies cannot control if, for example, it's a plumbing issue. 

One day I got a call transferred to me by another coworker because he was having issues with his headset. The little information I got was that this customer was angry that we were charging him our flat rate service fee of $125. His dishwasher was covered by the one year warranty and he claimed there was no water going into the machine. Our technician arrives, inspects the dishwasher and can't find any reason as to why it wouldn't be getting water, so he checks the water going into the house and, lo and behold, his water had been shut off the entire time. Samsung, the manufacturer of the dishwasher, reviewed the case and declined to pay for it since they hadn't produced a faulty machine, the tech tested it after turning the water on and it worked perfect. Now back to present day, the customer calls me...

Customer is CX

Me is... Me

Me: ""Hi my name is _____, sorry about the transfer, my coworker's headset isn't connecting. I understand you need some clarification on some charges?""

CX: ""I am VERY UPSET! My dishwasher is under warranty so why should I have to pay this?""

Here I explain to him what I said above.

CX: ""That's unfair, I shouldn't be charged. It's under warranty! And on top of that you sent the bill to collections. Collections, really?! Unprofessional!""

Me: ""Sir, we had sent the bill to you 3 times already, we emailed, called, left voicemails but heard nothing back from you. The inspection happened almost 6 months ago. I'm sorry you're upset but Samsung declined to pay since that responsibility fell onto you.""

CX: ""I can't even believe this. I want your name right now.""

Keep in mind I've summarized a lot of our conversation already since for the most part it was just him repeating the same things. After being on the phone for probably around 15 minutes listening to this guy complain I was losing my patience and got a little snippy (my version of snippy anyway).

Me: ""As I said, my name is _____.""

CX: ""I need your last name too!""

Me: ""Um, no, I'm not going to give you that. I'm the only _____ that works at this company in this city. If you need to speak to me again-""

CX: ""NO!""

The guy is full on yelling over the phone now.

CX: "" I need your last name RIGHT NOW. I'm going to sue you! You can't just take me to collections!""

Riiiiight. Sue the barely 21 year old, bottom of the ladder, girl for following protocol that was set up by a completely different company. Also this is the first time I ever spoke or got involved with this guy's case.

Me: ""Sir, I personally didn't send your bill to collections. Your issue is with Samsung's warranty policy, which you agreed to, and the fact that you wouldn't pay a bill that must be paid. At this point all I can you is speak to a manager and they will call you back when they're available.""

I kept pushing to get the customer off the phone for a little while longer, there wasn't anything I could actually do for him. Eventually we wrapped up the conversation, he told me to ""expect to be sued"" a couple more times and that was that. In the end my company pulled back the bill from collections and waived his fee, because they were such huge pushovers. Kind of sucks the guy was the last to laugh, he said some very horrible things to me and got away with it. Oh well, that's customer service I guess."

This happened sometime ago. Nothing major but it did leave me in a confused state and end up wondering why this happened. I work in a small retail store that sells newspapers & magazines, stationery, lotteries and other miscellaneous things.

Middle-aged woman buys 2 magazines. Both magazines were standard celebrity-gossip type A4 size magazines. Transaction is all good and she asks for a plastic bag to carry her magazines in. I comply, give her one and help her put the magazines inside. As soon as I finish, she rejects it and asks for a bigger bag. I didn't question it but comply anyway and give her the next size up. 

**Nope.**

Demands an even bigger one. I had to go under the counter to look for the biggest size bag I could find. After about 15 seconds I managed to find one, threw the magazines inside (gently of course) and told her to have a nice day.

Not even out of the store (and still in my sight), she takes the magazines out of the bag and throws the bag away into the rubbish box. She also mutters something under her breath... complaining about the service? Or maybe I pulled off a face that said I was a bit angry at her for this? I don't know.

I stood there confused. Thankfully there was a customer waiting and got myself back into reality fairly quickly. When there was no one left, I took the bag out of the rubbish box (thankfully it wasn't dirty since there was mainly paper in there) and put it back where it was before this all happened.

Very rarely do I get weird interactions since most of the regulars are elderly and they, for the most part, are fairly kind and often straight to the point."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cyri5a/i_may_just_have_experienced_absolute_density/,"I may just have experienced absolute density. I'm not trying to be mean, but I genuinely think that my worldview was just shaken to its core.

I work at a small photostudio as an university student. I love my job. I do the late shifts, my boss is amazing and my coworker is a nice fellow. Sometimes, like today, work is pretty slow which allows me to type out what I just witnessed. This happened literally 10 Minutes ago.

We do the usual corporate photography stuff: biometric passport pictures, business portraits, family, pregnancy, the occasional erotic and sometimes weddings. But we also do things we call ""Fun Articles"". These are little goodies with printed on pictures, for example pillows, phone cases, mugs, etc. ...

There's just two things to know:

1. If you provide the picture, every article is 9.90. If we shoot the picture, the article is 15.95.
2. We don't ""make"" these goodies in our studio (we're like 24m^(2), 16 effectively), we just take the order and our printing facility makes them and sends them to us. This usually takes 3-4 days.

Today, person X came with a friend, y. Y didn't say anything to me, but from what I could hear I already thought ""This might be fun."" They were not an elderly couple, nor did they look uh.. special. Mid to late 20s, fairly upper class, based on their clothes and accessoire.

X came to me and started asking questions about a heart shaped pillow (HSP). The conversation was incredibly long and surreal but I tried to condense it:

X: ""Hello, how much for the HSP?""  
Me: ""Hi, The pillow is 9.90 if you provide the picture. If we shoot the picture, it's 15.95.""   
X: ""So I just print it out and bring it to you?""  
Me (confused): ""No, that doesn't work. We need the digital file.""  
X: ""So you can't print here?""  
Me: ""Uhm... In this studio we print on paper. If you want a HSP, we take your order and print it at our printing facility. A few days later you can pick it up from here.""  
X: ""So you can't print here?""

I was stunned. It was literally the exact same question. I was afraid how to respond because I don't usually have to deal with dense people like this. I didn't understand that she didn't understand. Or maybe she was asking about being able to print it in this exact location? Did she want to see our equipment? Did she test me? I DON'T KNOW!

Me: ""We can't print the HSP here. But we do have a printing facility that will print the HSP for us. It's outside the city ^((not really but hush)). I can take your order if you want.""  
X: ""Yea so the printer isn't here?""  
Me: ""No. It's a little to big for this studio.""  
X: ""Because I have a picture right with me."" 

She pointed at her phone like she won something. Or like she thought I was dense.

  
Me: ""That's convenient, so just send it to our mail adress.""  
X (struggling, stunned): ""How do I do that?""

I reach for a card with our mail adress and show her.

Me: ""You put this mail into the ""to:""- bar and add the picture to the mail. Or you tap on the picture, tap ""send..."" and use ""Mail"". Then you just enter our mail adress.""

X stared at the card, then hat her phone, finally at me. She. Literally. Froze. And stared at me with her mouth open. Even Y started to feel uncomfortable.

X: ""Okay, I will do that. Thank you.""

And then they left. Like, it was right there. She had the phone in her hand, unlocked. Her other hand held the mail adress, the key to our cheesy piece of mass produced fun specifically targetted at baby boomers. I still don't understand how someone in my generation, let them be a few years older, has managed to never learn to mail a picture over the phone. Sometimes, when there's old people trying to do the same thing they just hand me their phone and let me do it for them. But she didn't even ask me. She just took the card and left.

 I'm still baffled."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cyj6yi/mama_bear/,"Mama bear So this is a bit of a twist on the ""we're closed, ma'am"" tales. 

A little over 20 years ago, I was a teenager and worked in the Chicago suburbs for a video rental store. This particular Sunday happened in the middle of winter, and any midwesterner will tell you that winters are brutal. It just so happened that a blizzard that the meteorologists had been predicting for almost a week was bearing down on us at this moment, and the district manager had just called to tell us we'd be closing early. And I'm talking seven hours early. My car wasn't very reliable in the snow so my mom, completely voluntarily and without even telling me she was doing it, drove down to the store to pick me up. She was in the vestibule waiting for me to finish closing duties, and the outside door behind her was locked. We had just closed all the registers when the following happened. 

A customer approached the doors, and finding them locked before our normal closing time, started banging on them.

Coworker: (shouting through the locked door) We're closed, sir. Due to the blizzard.

Cust: What?! The blizzard isnt supposed to hit for another hour or so! (There was already at least 8 inches on the ground and the winds were at least 40 mph. I really don't want to know what this guy's definition of a blizzard was if that wasn't it.)

Coworker: I'm sorry, sir, but we've already closed the registers and can't open them back up. We'll probably be open again tomorrow as long as the manager can get in.

Cust: But I know what I want! I'll just run in and get it and be out in less than a minute!

Coworker: Like I said, the registers are closed, and we can't reopen them. I'm sorry. 

(My mom at this point is bristling. I can see it in her eyes. She's a mama bear type. Always has been and always will be.)

Cust: (starts calling us every name under the sun) I drove out in this because you guys were supposed to be open til midnight and like a bunch of pansies, you're closing early?! This is Chicago! No one closes early for a little snow! (He's right, no one closes in Chicago for snow. Except when it's a blizzard.)

My mother has had it at this point. She walks right up to the glass and starts screaming at the guy. Everyone left in the store could hear it as, I'm sure, all the employees in the other businesses in the strip mall could.

Mom: My daughter is in there, along with the sons and daughters of many other mothers! They need to get home, safe, and out of this weather! Anything that's going to delay my baby, or any of the other babies in here, getting home in a blizzard is going to have to go through me first!

The guy didnt say another word, turned around, and trudged back to his car. Smart move on his part. He lived to see another day. I love my mom. All of my coworkers loved my mom after that evening as well."

https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/bm13ku/youre_so_pretty/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Well, about a month ago, the little girls father came in with her. I was at the customer service desk. I was talking to LG ( Little Girl ) about her summer and how her house is getting redone. ( the store was dead ) 

And suddently her father goes "" [LGs real name] ask her the question!"" 

LG: Can you be my babysitter?!

Of course, I accepted. I love kids, and have babysitting experience so now each time she comes into my store she announces to people I am her babysitter and How I am the best. Even to my co workers. 

The wonders of a five year old and her favorite babysitter/retail worker. 

When its dead in the store and she happens to be shopping with her dad she asks me questions about my job. I dont mind. <3 

Be nice if she stopped stealing my stickers though. Haha"

I currently work a service desk, seeing, hearing, witnessing totally over the top coo coo crazy behavior is nothing new, last night I had a TOPPER , a literal cherry that will sit on the top of my crazy cake until the ""next one.""

I answer the service desk phone to find a woman who opens the conversation with ..""My Husband is in the store I am calling from home, he called me & he is lost. He was told to go the the back of the store to find moving boxes, he's looking for a sofa box and he can't find it. I know I saw them there ,the last person I talked to told me you had them."" 

My head...""A sofa sized box? A box?  Ummm NO lady.""

What I say is  ""I am sorry but I do not believe we have boxes large enough to fit a sofa , we have plastic bags large enough to fit a mattress but we do not have sofa sized boxes in store.""

Her: ""I just spoke to some one else who said YOU DID have them and my poor husband is lost, and can't find them. I want YOU to go find my husband & help him, now.""

Me: ""I am sorry I can do an overhead & have some one from the department meet him but I can not leave the desk, our moving supplies are located on the back wall in bay 13,  please ask him to stay where he is and some one will be there shortly.""

I hang up & call the department who says they are on the way. 

A few minutes later I get a call from the same Woman who says her husband just called her & he's walked from toilets to lighting -he has not seen any sofa sized moving boxes, there is no one any where to help him. FYI I asked her to tell him to stay put....but......She again tells me her ""poor husband"" is lost in the back of the store & demands I leave the desk to find him....( as if he's lost in the forest with blind folds on & maybe 12 years old AT BEST.)

Me: ""Ma'am I can not leave the desk. I have called for assistance for your husband, please ask him to stay where he is & some one will be there shortly. I am sorry he appears to be looking for something we do not have in the store""

Her: "" Are you customer service? What the hell is your job? My husband is in the back of the store, no one is there. He is lost....LOST and alone!! My poor husband is ALL alone.""

I am trying to reassure her some one is on the way to help while letting her know we DO NOT have sofa sized boxes. She is screaming at me about her poor lost husband & how much I suck. At this point I am 20 minutes into this woman & we have actual people staring at me in line wanting help...one of my co-workers comes up behind me & say ""Opps !"" as she presses the hang up button - disconnecting me from the screaming MotherWife in mid-conversation.

My first thought is DAMN IT !

 She has my name !! 

To be honest I am glad to be out of the endless MotherWife spiral & her clueless Husband who keeps calling his wife instead of staying put or asking for help himself. I start helping customers in line ...sure enough a few minutes later she calls back , a coworkers sees her name on the caller ID & simply transfers it to a MOD.

Long story short she made a complaint on me for hanging up on her & not being helpful. My manager goes to the back of the store...finds her wandering little lost husband....after a few minutes of conversation my MOD says ""We do not have sofa sized boxes"" The husband says....""Oh did my wife call you ? Yeah..she's CRAZY."""

They're curved a few steps up so you can't see around the corner as you're coming back down them, meaning if anything/anyone is obstructing the stairs at the bottom, you're not going to know until you're basically falling over them when you're on the way back down.

I needed to go upstairs. A middle aged woman and her 2 grandkids were sat in a line on the stairs, leaving a couple of inches on the one side free for people to try to pass by. I told her, ""Sorry guys, you can't sit on the stairs. It's a fire exit and it's dangerous because someone could fall over you.""

She immediately got snappy with me and said, ""I'm sure we'd move if there was a fire, love!"" I said that's fine but it's still a health and safety issue so you can't stay sitting there. She yelled and said I was being ridiculous, then stood up from the stairs. I headed up the stairs to get the thing I needed. She sarcastically told the kids as I started to walk, ""Let's stand up and as soon as that's woman's gone we'll sit back down."" As I got to the top of the stairs and out of view she yelled ""JOBSWORTH!""

She was gone from the shop by the time I came back down. The customer I was getting the item for saw her temper tantrum and told me when I got back to the till how laughable her behaviour was. Great example to set for the grandkids!"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cyh93q/no_thats_not_turquoise/,"""No that's not turquoise"" So this happened a few weeks ago, and I was so dumbfounded by this encounter that my brain almost shut down. It begins with a woman coming up to my register while I was working the cigarette aisle. C will be customer and M will be me.

> C: I'd like a pack of American Spirit Turquoise.

That was the first thing said to me. No hello or anything like that, so this should have been my first red flag.

> M: Okay I'll get that for you ma'am.

So I go to grab the pack of cigarettes. To anyone that's never seen a pack of American Spirit Turquoise, not only are they the color turquoise, but they also say turquoise in pretty plain letters on the pack.

So I show her the cigarettes to confirm it's the right pack, as I always do.

> M: Are these the ones ma'am?

> C: No I said the turquoise ones.

> M (dumbfounded): These are the turquoise ones.

> C: No, turquoise is light blue.

> M: But it says turquoise on the box.

> C: No, I want the light-blue ones.

She said that last line with a rude-sounding tone as though she felt she was dumbing herself down to my level. At this point, I knew I had to check her out before my brain shut down, so I grabbed the light-blue pack and asked her if that was right. She said yes, I scanned it, she paid, and I sat there contemplating my life decisions that led me to that point while I checked out the next customer, who looked just as dumbfounded as I probably did.

tl;dr: Customer wanted turquoise color pack of cigarettes, but didn't know what color turquoise was. Walked out with light-blue pack instead because she wouldn't listen to me."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cyb0yz/im_calling_corporate_because_you_used_your_radio/,"“I’m Calling Corporate Because You Used Your Radio” This was about two/three years ago when I still worked Loss Prevention at a large store that sold designer things for cheap.

It was the morning, so we only had one cashier, the Front End Supervisor (FES), until the next one came in at 10:30. We had opened at 8:30 and already had about ten people waiting to come in, so you can see the issue.

The only other people besides the FES and myself, were two associates each assigned to the fitting rooms (one on the first floor and one on the second floor), and two managers. The managers were in the stockroom dealing with a large shipment that the stock team wasn’t able to finish, so they were trying to get everything tagged and ready to go out.

Being the only Loss Prevention there, I was assigned to be by the door to watch for potential shoplifters (customers that avoided making eye contact with me when I greeted them, large empty bags that were open, customers near tall racks just staring at me or the cashiers). I noticed that by 9, there was already a line of about seven people waiting to be rung up.

One customer was third in line for purchases, and calls over to me.

Customer: “Can you call for another cashier please?”

I nod, and immediately used my radio headset to ask our managers if they were able to help with the line. Our store manager responded with a “No”. Our FES is a very fast cashier and had managed to get to the customer that had asked for help in five minutes.

As soon as she was done, the customer walked right up to me and asked me for my name. I told her my name and this is what she said:

Customer: “I’m going to call corporate, because you were so rude to ignore me.”

I responded that I didn’t know what she meant.

Customer: “You didn’t ask for another cashier. You ignored me.”

I told her that I didn’t ignore her, that I asked our managers if the could help with the line. My radio headset is very noticeable, and I motioned to it.

Customer: “I didn’t hear you ask anyone! I didn’t hear an announcement!”

No joke, she actually thought I could only asked for help using the announcement system. I told her I used my radio, which doesn’t connect to our PA system and our manager had no one else that could help.

She scoffed and left. I never heard back about what happened so I assumed she didn’t call

I reside in North Carolina and with Hurricane whatever it’s called forecasted to hit us, the store has been busy with people buying water, bread and nonperishables. There’s one of the CSM’s walking up to each of us at the registers and telling us that we can only sell 3 cases of water bottles per person. Pretty much on cue (queue?) here comes a lady with two kids (probably early teens) in tow ,with 5 cases of the bottled water in their buggy. I suppose she collected them before the limit was put down (there was an employee telling customers in the water aisle they can only purchase 3). I tell her; 

Me- “I’m sorry ma’am, you can only purchase 3 of the cases of water.”

L- “What? Wait, what? Why?”

Me- “With the storm approaching, they set the limit so that there’s more to go around for others.”

L- “But what does it matter if I’m paying for it?”

Me- “It just so that it means there’s more people can buy water they might need” 

L- “I need the water too. So why can’t I have it?”


Me- “The limit is just so that there’s more water to go around.”

L- “But I need the water more!”

At this point the woman wiping tears from her eyes with her sleeve

Me- “I apologize ma’am, however if you return tomorrow I’m sure there will be more to go around. It’s just at the moment we can only sell 3 cases per group.” 

L (sniffling)- “Ok I guess that works” 

I ring up her water and other items, give her her receipt and tell her to have a good night. 

The lady was really sweet and I suppose just didn’t understand exactly why there was the limit. It’s hard for me to explain but I felt that they actually did need the water more than others. No mean customer, no real drama, just a nice lady who just seemed to be looking out for her family. I genuinely felt bad for having to deny her the water. I hope to see her tomorrow.

UPDATE: I ran into again today as I walked in to start my shift. She had some groceries in her cart, greeted me and said that when she got home, she and her husband deducted that not only did they not need 5, but they didn’t even need 3. She said that they only really could’ve used 2. So she was there to return one of the cases and buy some groceries."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cycdyr/tales_from_the_bakery_the_greatest_heist_in/,"Tales from the bakery: The greatest heist in retail history Hi. Some of you may remember the post I made 4 months ago, about the guy who bricked his phone by smashing a bun inside of it, before calling my bakery and demanding a new phone. Yeah well, I said that I had more amazing stories, and this is going to be one of them.

For those who didn't read the previous post; [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/bafn0m/one_man_three_buns/) it is. Basically I work in a small bakers department inside of a supermarket downtown. It's a decent job. Usually boring, but sometimes we see unbelievable s\*\*\*. Enter: *Tales from the bakery*

Okay, so. This was a pretty ordinary day about 7 or 8 months ago. I was working my weekly shift, and I had around an hour left or so.

As I'm assisting customers, I notice an extremely drunk guy entering the store through the front entrance. As far as I'm concerned he wasn't harassing anyone, and behaved politely apart from the occasional loss of balance when he walked. He goes through the automatic doors and into the main supermarket and I didn't think more of it.

Around 20 minutes pass, and I finally get a bit of a breather from all the customers. As I'm drinking a glass of water, I look back over at the main entrance, and I start to notice that the people walking in appear to be looking strangely at something on the other side of the entrance. This, however, is out of my line of sight, and I assume that they're just looking at something normal.

**Until.** A large, strangely familiar man enters my line of sight, and appears to be heading the wrong way out of the main entrance. Now, our doors are automatic, and only open from one side. This means that in order for him to get out the wrong way, he had to wait for customers entering and then bail out the door before it closed again. The man is walking at an extremely slow pace, almost like he's dragging something.

I look over at the customer service desk, trying to get a hold of their attention, and I notice that they were looking through the surveillance cameras. I walk over to them and say ""Hey guys. Some guy is heading out of the entrance the wrong way."". They then turn around, facing me, looking a bit perplexed and reply ""Uhhh, yeah, some guy also just pissed all over the electronics department, and we're missing a 50' inch TV""

**Oohhf\*\*\***

I do a complete 180, faster than I've ever done before. I look back at the entrance, and there he is. F\*\*\*\*\*\* soaked with urine, from feet to his belly. Wearing a black bowlers hat and a large beige jacket. And in his hands, dragging across the urine soaked floor? A 50' f\*\*\*\*\*\* inch TV. The guy is f\*\*\*ing wasted. And he's taking all the time in the world. Dragging the TV through the entrance at a maximum speed of around 1 mph, while trying to maneuver past the dozens of customers looking at him like he just fell down from space. He is taking all the time in the f\*\*\*ing world.

I look back at the customer service representatives, trying to decode their facial expression because I myself am at a loss for words. They look at the man, then at me, then at the man again, all while carrying an expression on their face that instantly confirmed that **this had never happened before.** They quickly grab the phone and call the head manager. Within 15 seconds, the manager comes storming out, over to the customer service desk. So far, the bandit has only moved around half way out of the entrance, so the manager has enough time to get him.

When confronted by the manager, the man appears to have little to no understanding of what he was doing. He is now carrying the same facial expression as the people walking past him at the entrance. He looks at the TV like it came from the sky, claiming to not really know where it came from. The manager is having none of it, and tries escorting him into the back office. He ends out getting help from another customer, due to the man not really being able to keep his balance. They enter the back office and I turn my head, looking at the customers at the entrance. Everyone has that facial expression now. Nobody understands what the f\*\*\* just happened.

2-3 minutes pass, and the police now enter the store. They head though the front entrance, trying their best to avoid the piss soaked spots just like every other customer has had to do, and head for the back office. I assumed that this was the last that I would see or hear of the TV bandit, but boy was I wrong.

Another 15 minutes pass, and the piss has now been mostly cleaned up by some poor customer service rep. I am handling customers as always, when I see the manager heading towards my bakers department. I look him in the eyes and I see: absolutely nothing. My usually happy manager is f\*\*\*\*\*\* dead inside. Completely emotionally obliterated. He looks at me and says ""Anon... Gloves... I... I need some"". I hand him the gloves and ask him what's going on, but he just turns his back and walks to the back office, looking like he has absolutely nothing left to live for.

Then, after another 20 minutes... The man emerges. Carried by two policemen, with his pants undone, no shoes and a big f\*\*\*\*\*\* grin on his face. Behind them is my manager. Carrying a bag of:

**Literal s\*\*\*, mixed with underwear and a pair of shoes.**

Turns out; when the man was escorted to the back office and met by two policemen, he cursed a bit at them before taking a s\*\*\* on the floor as the police were trying to interrogate him. My poor manager was the one who had to clean it up. And now, having emptied both his blatter and bowel inside of the store, and lost the last remaining bit of his balance, all he was physically and mentally able to do, was to put on a big smile as he was being dragged out of the store. And you wanna know the most f'ed up part? He looked complete. The look of a man who regrets nothing.

**Tl;dr** An insanely drunk guy went to the supermarket I work at. Pissed in the electronics department. Stole a 50' inch flatscreen TV. Tried to drag it casually out of the entrance. Claimed he didn't know where it came from when he was confronted. Got escorted to the back office before finally taking a s\*\*\* on the floor and being dragged out by two officers all while smiling like the happiest man in the world.

I have to this day never seen or heard from the TV bandit. But whereever you might be, I salute you for carrying out the greatest heist in all of retail history."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cy75dx/thats_state_law/,"THAT'S STATE LAW! So I work at a liquor store in my hometown and had quite the interesting exchange with an older couple a few weeks ago.

To set up this happened on a Sunday afternoon probably 30 minutes before we were about to close. The store was packed and we only had one register opened as the other one was being counted down. Enter the older couple.

They search around the store for a few minutes occasionally asking me questions about the products and they finally come to thier decision. I ring up all of thier items and give them their total. 

After I give it to them they seemed shocked that it was as high as it was. (They got a two 6-packs and a big bottle of scotch.) 

Husband: ""Well that can't be right."" 

Me: ""Ummmm let me see. Yes sir $79.99 for the scotch and the six packs are both 9.99""

Wife:""Oh well this bottle is marked at 15.99.""

M:"" Oh hang on let me check."" It was the only one of those bottles to be marked at that price as we make out price tags for each bottle individually. 

M: ""I'm sorry about that mix up. I can give you 15% off the bottle if you still want it.""

W: ""I thought you had to give it to me at the price it was marked?"" 

M: ""I'm sorry ma'am but we have a store policy that if it's mismarked more than $15 I can only give you 15% off. If it was under $15 I could give it to you at the marked price.""

H: ""No you have to give it to me at 15.99. I'm the customer and the customer is always right.""

M: "" I'm very sorry sir but if you still want the bottle I can give it to you for 15% off."" 

H:""NO! YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT TO ME AT THE MARKED PRICE! THAT'S STATE LAW""!

W:"" Yeah that's state law!"" 

M: ""Well I've never heard of that state law but I can't give it to you at 15.99.""

H: ""Well then I'm gonna need your name and your name"" (my coworker had come back from counting the drawer) ""Your bosses name and the number of this store.""

I comply and give him the info he was asking for and they went on their way out the door without the 2 six packs that they wanted. 

""I'm gonna own this store by the end of the week"" he yells as he walks out the door. So I carry on with the 15 minutes left we are open taking care of the rest of the customers who were so polite to wait the 10 minutes this was going on. 

After we close the store and lock the doors I go to put up the bottle of scotch that he wanted and wouldn't you know it. Sitting right next to the bottle wanted was a cheap 15.99 bottle of brandy that had a sticker marked 79.99. I laugh quietly to myself as I switch the stickers back and put the bottle back on the shelf. 

As you can probably infer we never heard back from them and the store is still under the same ownership it was."

Me: *utterly bewildered at what she hoped to achieve with this interaction.* Okay.

She left after that. She didn't greet me, or ask if there were anymore available, she stalked up to me in an entirely different section and shouted at me about it being the last one. I still haven't figured out if she was trying to help me replenish the stock, or wanted another... But I'm pretty sure she complained to someone upstairs as she left.

Anyways. I come in for my 2pm shift. I'm here maybe 10 minutes before I see a guy ride in on a pump. He's older, very tan and as the title would suggest, in a speedo. Yay.

He comes in to use the restroom. Great. People kinda snicker because this is a very hick town and it's just not something you see. We find out later speedo guy, who is actually very nice, just spacey, isn't from here. SHOCKER.

He comes out of the restroom and gets ahold of my coworker to let her know that he's in need of help and that he's shoved his credit card INSIDE the receipt slot and not the card slot on the pump. Fantastic. We are both relatively new, she hired in a few weeks before me and I've been here less than a month and we aren't trained how to handle these situations. So she goes out with him and finagles with the pump. Calls the manager, finds the key to open the receipt slot. Nothing. They can't find it. The guys wanting to take the WHOLE ASS PUMP APART and my coworker is like no? I'll get in trouble. Don't do that. Don't even mess with it I've got it.

She comes back in to call another manager who had to come back to work but within 2 seconds the card was out and all was good. But inside the store, people are howling with laughter, taking pics, etc. I felt bad because the guy really didn't seem all there. He told me later that he had been in a wreck and should have died but lived and I said ""hey you're still here that's what matters."" He was nice and apologized profusely but yeah. Been a weird day."

I did my best to get him checked out as expediently as possible while remaining polite, as the stench coming from him was something awful,  as the individual had clearly at some point soiled/urinated on himself.

After I finish checking him out, he asks if he could leave his merchandise with me while he picks up a prescription and trys on some new clothes before purchasing them. I stash his merchandise in an area for that under the counter, while he goes to the outside pharmacy window. After about thirty minutes he comes back into the store and grabs several items of clothing, and goes into the restroom to try them on. Fortunately they fit him (I'm not sure what we would have done had they not and he tried putting them back where he found them, short of disposing of them), and he grabbed a few more to buy.

&#x200B;

 I'm checking out the clothing the clothing he now wants to purchase, and when I'm finished he grabs his old, soiled, wet clothing and drops it onto my checkout stand and asks me to put into a plastic bag for him. I'm at this point about ready to break down and cry, as I struggle with an extreme inability to handle dirty/unclean objects as such. I turn to a coworker, and she whispers to me to have him do it himself. I grab a plastic bag and tell him store policy prevents me from handling personal possessions. There really isn't a policy like that... I just couldn't bring myself to handle something like that. After he finally leaves the store (I made sure to get him his merchandise from earlier) I probably spent a good ten minutes with my checkout stand closed as I repeatedly washed/disinfected everything.

Adding to the story, I had the next day off, so I didn't get to witness it, however according to my manager he came back the next day shirtless, tried on a shirt, and wandered out with it without paying., and was banned from the store."

L: Why can’t you help me?

L: So you can’t fix it?

M: No, ma’am. I’m sorry, you’re at a pharmacy, not a jewelry store.

EDIT 2: My store had always been a pharmacy. Used to be a mom-and-pop pharmacy before an infamous corporation bought the place and expanded.

What bothers me most about this is not customers saying ‘just looking’ or ‘I’m just browsing’, it’s the ones that straight up ignore me, like this fine fellow:

Me: *notices they have the headphones on and goes up to get there attention* What are ya looking for today?

Customer: *notices me and sees me actually trying to talk to him, ignores me and walks right past me*

I've been working at a national sports retailer in the UK for about 2 months now and we have a rather large shoe department. It's currently our ""Back to school"" week and our busiest period. As such staff from other departments have been sent into help. Problem is these staff either don't know how to find a shoe in our rather large stock room or simply take far too long. Somehow even though I've only been working 2 months I was deemed the most experienced person by management and placed as the stock room boy. It was my job to tidy it up, but mainly to grab any shoes that are radioed through to me from the 5 customer assistants outside.

I was starting to get quite good at it, running all over the place and finding each pair of shoes in around 20 seconds. But around 1PM we started to get super busy and all of a sudden all 5 of my colleagues radioed through 2-4 pairs each! It became super overwhelming, each shoe has a 6 digit code, a 2 digit colour code and then the size they want. There is only so many numbers I could remember in my short term memory and I'm trying my best to control the flow of request asking only one person at a time for a single code. When I get onto one of my new colleagues in the confusion I thought she was asking for a Nike shoe. Yet when I went to the Nike walls, I couldn't find the shoe ending in the code she wanted (but the code wasn't entirely wrong for a Nike branded shoe.) Some of our shoes are kept on the table stock outside the stock room and I say I believe it's table stock. Yet she's adamant it's in here. So dripping in sweat I decide to leave the stockroom to see the shoe myself, only to find the kid wearing not a pair of Nikes but ""Kickers""; which also start in the same ID code range. I immediately apologies for the misunderstanding but his dad then says something along the lines of ""Are you thick? How on earth do you miss-hear Nike for Kickers, they sound nothing alike. We've been waiting ages hurry up!""

I just wanted to scream back at him, here's the stock room door, if you think you can find it any quicker go ahead! But thought it best not to respond and just ran back into the stock room to grab his shoes. I couldn't quite believe his audacity, firstly he can't of been waiting longer than 5min (a few min for me to get on to him and then a few min of me searching for a non-existent Nike) and my colleague serving him had a radio of her own so he must of been able to of also heard the barriage of shoe requests I was inundated with or at least see me throwing piles upon piles of shoes out the door!

My GOD if this woman could have gotten any redder, she would've been classified as a tomato and joined the cheeses on her belt!

I grab a pack of cheese... scanned it...

Just in freaking time! Bagger and the manager came back just as she was about to say something else.

> Manager: Is there a problem?

> Customer: Your damn right there's a problem! Your cashier here is saying I can't get the $0.50 discount on my brownie mix and is now trying to cheat me out of the discount on my cheese!

> Manager: Do you have a rewards card? The discount applies at the end of the transaction if you do.

> Customer: NO, AND I DON'T WANT ONE.

> Manager: Then I'm sorry, ma'am. You will not get the discount without a card. It's completely free to sign up and can be used immediately. EnragedErin has a bunch of them here for any customer who wants a card.

> Customer: I don't WANT a card! Clean out your ears!

My manager CLEARLY did not like that. With a calm inhale, he signaled for me to step aside and cancelled her entire transaction.

> Manager: I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're holding up the line and starting to become a disturbance to the other customers.

> Customer: I'm not leaving!

> Manager: Yes, you are. *he went to grab the customer's arm to escort her out of the building and turned to look at me before walking away* Sorry about that, EnragedErin. Please ring up the other customers while Bagger puts these items into a return buggy.

While Bagger grabbed the items I had sent to the far end, I looked at the customer that was behind the raging lady. There was that sympathetic grin you could almost tell was a grimace.

> Customer 2: Wow, you really got thrown to the wolves, didn't you?

> Me: Phew... tell me about it. Anyways, I am so sorry for the delay! How's your day so far?

The rest of my shift went without incident, but holy crap I almost burst out laughing thinking about it when I got home. Just the ridiculousness of this middle aged woman pitching a fit... over cheese and brownies."

He answers ""You could give me your employee discount"" I could have for that but it was about to be holiday season and we only get our discount up to a certain amount of clothes bought and I wanted to get some things cheaper for my family, my friends and me and maybe a couple of co-workers who already used the credit they had on their discount card.

Surprisingly, I was offered a management position in guest service/front lanes ... but it basically meant I got .25 more an hour to do the same thing the big guys do for half the pay. But whatever. I liked my job and was pretty good at it.

Me: new *kinda* manager

Kelly: new cashier

Paula: extreme middle aged couponer gone rouge

I was in the office that had a one way mirror type window, doing paperwork. The lane in front of the window had our new hire. Kelly. She was there for this exact reason. 

I look up from my work to check on her now and then.  I see Kelly looking back and forth, kind of panicked and I calmly walked out to see A METRIC FK TON of coupons stacked in front of her. Kelly tried to scan each one, some working others not. 

Paula flips out each time one doesn’t scan, screaming at this poor girl.

P: I’m sure there’s some sort of override, just do it.

K: N-no ma’am I honestly can’t, it won’t let me.

P: I’m pretty sure you’re lying but I have places to be.... what about the rest?!

(Mind you this is about 25+ coupons at least)

Me, looking through the massive pile, sorting expired and irrelevant coupons: Okay ma’am. You have 3 valid coupons left. It brings your total to $xx.xx.

P: YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. I double checked each of those coupons!

Me, gesturing to both piles I made while sorting: these are expired... many by quite a while. This other pile are ones that don’t apply to any of your items. I know it’s frustrating, but I have to follow policy not just for the store, but for the manufacturers. 

P: (I’m pretty sure you know what she said)

Me: ma’am... I am the manager. That’s why I came out here to sort this out. 

P: I don’t believe you , you’re just a kid! Get me the real manager!

Me, gesturing to my name badge: I am indeed the manager of the front end. (She doesn’t know what our acronyms for managers are) I don’t want to be rude, but we cannot accept these coupons. I have throw the expired ones out, but you can keep the others in case they apply to other items in the future. 

P: FINE. Just let me pay so I can leave. And keep your coupons! I’m never shopping here again!

Kelly nodded and I gave a quick side hug then a thumbs up.  I believe she stayed there till the place closed down. Great gal.

Of course her threat of never coming back was a lie. I saw Paula several times after but never had to put her in her place again. She apparently followed the rules after an 18 yr old told her about herself.

Edit: WOW. This blow up was not expected but thank y’all! 

To clarify a few things... They got rid of the WHOLE photo department altogether (in my store, least. I think some still have them... but mine closed completely a couple years ago anyways, sooooo). It just wasn’t doing well cos not a lot of people in 08 were getting film developed. BUT they liked my work ethic and people skills so instead of letting me go or moving me to cashier, they moved me up.

Again, it was like *barely* a promotion technically. I was an *assistant* assistant manager basically. I made like 8ish dollars an hour. But don’t think that means they didn’t overwork me and task me with things above my pay grade, like this. COS THEY ABSOLUTELY DID, let me tell ya. 

And the rouge/rogue thing? I’m leaving that mistake in there cos the comments about it are side-splitting. Keep going."

One night, I'm on a closing shift. It's around 6PM and I'm working with this obnoxious new girl (been a few months) and we don't really get along well. We settle for just not talking to each-other as much as possible and getting through the night. The door opens, and in walks an older hippie lady.

She's got waist length grey hair, bell bottom jeans, a bright tie-die shirt, and large purple sunglasses.

Obnoxious Girl is at the counter next to me and lady walks up and asks about changing her oil, and then about tires for some reason (which we didn't even sell). I recommend one brand, Obnoxious Girl recommends a different one. We then argue back and forth for a minute about which is better.

At the end of the argument, Hippie Lady, pulls her sunglasses down her nose and looks over them at us.

Hippie Lady: What, are you two married?

Me and Obnoxious Girl both stare at her in shock, and then both scoff and laugh.

Me: To her?!

OG: To him?!

Hippie Lady laughs and turns around, gets her oil change, and leaves. OG and I laugh about it a little bit, and then get back to work and mostly ignoring each-other.

We celebrated our seventh anniversary last month."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cxrfrp/that_time_i_accidentally_a_shopping_cart_with/,"That time I accidentally a shopping cart with soda in it. Hello TFR, long time no see. I'm still out of the retail business, but this story from my early days at my old job popped into my head and I thought I'd share it here.

During the early years, one of the worst customers I remembered was what one could consider to be a Karen. Yeah, she was just that entitled. I had two encounters with Karen, one where she came storming into the back room demanding a manager, and another that is the main focus of this post. Karen had lost her temper with the pharmacy department. I assume she couldn't get her pillz for some reason, but she had completed a transaction that included a 12 pack of Diet Cherry Pepsi cans. She demanded that someone bring the cart out to her car, as she was either unable or unwilling to push it out of the store herself. Guess who drew the short straw.

So I go along, and as I tried to bring the cart down off the sidewalk and onto the asphalt of the parking lot, something happened that I can't explain. I swear it wasn't intentional, but I lost control of the shopping cart and it flipped over, causing the 12 pack to make contact with the ground. Understand that if it was intentional, I'd be taking credit for my actions, not accepting responsibility. Karen witnessed this. I picked up the cart, and brought it to her trunk where we both noticed the 12 pack was leaking. One or more of the cans burst upon impact. I explain to Karen that she can get another one at no additional cost and no questions asked. The only problem is that Karen was very particular, she wanted Diet Cherry Pepsi, and that turned out to be our last 12 pack. She was furious and demanded to speak to the manager. Manager shows up, and she demands I be fired for my mistake. Manager chooses instead to stick up for me, since he knew me well enough to know that it's better if angry customers just leave, and I wouldn't have done this to her on purpose. Ultimately Karen left without even a refund, she was that angry. Never saw her again."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cxibx4/the_smellies/,"The Smellies Back in the early 90s I worked for a while as a 'weekender' at a well-known 'posh' UK supermarket in a small village in Hampshire.


There were many regular customers but the most notable were a couple who always seemed out of place in the surroundings. Filthy clothes, tattered shoes, matted, unwashed hair (and beard on the male half) and a pervasive whiff of peat bog and stale urine. They looked and behaved like Quentin Blake's illustrations from Roald Dahl's 'The Twits' made flesh and may have been husband and wife, siblings or both. They were imaginatively nicknamed The Smellies.


Every Saturday at about 10am they would shuffle through the door. Senior staff knew to be absent from the shop floor and only assistant section managers and we poor part timers were left to handle them. Most of the time, the trouble was limited to them bickering (Mrs Smelly would mutter something in an unintelligible croak and Mr Smelly would yell 'SHUT IT, YOU RATBAG') or them demanding a product which we didn't sell.


Until the Dark Day which changed one young assistant manager's life forever.


They were ambling about as per usual: 'Mumbly croak' 'SHUT IT' 'Croaky mumble' 'I SAID BUTTON IT' when Mrs Smelly bent down to get something from a low shelf. Mr Smelly grinned, adopted a pose reminiscent of the 'Skegness - It's So Bracing' poster and booted her up the arse. This propelled her face first into the own brand baked beans and she slid to the floor, immobile.


Andy the assistant section manager and I dashed over to help. Andy was one of our trained first aiders and performed the preliminary checks while I called the office upstairs to arrange an ambulance. She was unconscious and didn't appear to be breathing. Andy knew what he had to do. The colour drained from his face.


Mouth to mouth resuscitation. 


There then followed what I can only describe as one of the most heroic acts I've ever witnessed. Andy forged ahead, mouth to distressingly scabbed and bewhiskered mouth while Mr Smelly offered words of encouragement such as 'GET UP, YOU SLAG' while delivering the odd gentle punt to her side. 


The ambulance arrived and they were both spirited away not to be seen for a few weeks after which they returned as if nothing had happened. 


Andy spent a good half hour in the toilets rinsing his mouth. We took him to the pub down the road at lunchtime where three pints of Stella took the edge off it. He sat at the table with the thousand yard stare of a man who has seen too much in his short time. He kept muttering something that has haunted me ever since:


'I nearly swallowed her false teeth'"

One of my co-workers has a customer who wants to order a roll of special order carpet to be picked up by her contractor, who will install it. She has a very specific install date picked out and is very insistent on it.

Co-worker calls me over and the lady is asking about how soon the carpet will be in. I tell her that special ordering all of our carpets is a 2-3 week lead time.

""Well, your sign says installed in seven days!""

I explain to her that that lead time is if we're going to install it. Based on how soon we'd get out to her house to measure before the install, there's absolutely no way that we'd be able to get the carpet installed by her preferred date.

""But the sign says seven days!""

I again explain to her that the carpet is guaranteed in seven business days if we're going to install it, and the vendor won't rush the shipping if we're not installing it.

""Well, why can't you just tell the vendor that you're installing it so that they'll rush it?""

It doesn't work that way. First of all, all of our install jobs ship the carpet directly to the installer, not to the store, and they also can see when it's attached to an install order. The vendor would know that it's not being installed by us. Plus, we have contracts with them regarding the rush shipping for install jobs and we can't violate those contracts by lying to them.

""But I'm saving you money since you won't have to pay your installers!""

She's technically right since with our free carpet installation promotion, the payment to the installers does come out of our pocket, not the customer's, but that's irrelevant to the discussion.

I tell her that there's no way for us to get it that fast. It simply can't be done. Unfortunately, the carpets that we carry in the store aren't the same quality as the one she wanted to special order (which was top of the line) so we just didn't have an option for her that would be as fast as she needed.

She got up in a huff and demanded to know where the closest carpet store is. I told her that I didn't know and she stormed off.

**TL;DR: Lady demands that I violate company and vendor policy because she absolutely has to have her carpet by a certain date.**"

It's me, your fearless bleeder is back again with another story. I was reminded of this event that took place while talking to old co-worker. Many, many, moons ago, when I was the owner and operator of my own computer store, we had a customer who would always come in, and attempt to show how he knew more about computers than we did. For this story, I will refer to him as Skip. I use this name for anyone I come across who is of limited intelligence on subjects. You know the type; they behave like they are always smarter than everyone else but have no idea what they are talking about. I started using the name mostly due to a friend I knew in high school. I could write several stories about his adventures in Skip land. But I haven’t found the right sub reddit for these yet. Anyway, on to the story.

It was a quiet day at the computer shop. We were getting a lot of repairs done, when who would happen to come in but our favorite customer, SKIP! He has his computer in hand, gently setting it down on the counter. I walk up to the counter and say, 

ME: good morning, I see it’s having problems again, what’s going on this time?

Skip: It’s the CPU, this time.

Me: OH? What makes you think it’s the CPU?

Skip: Every time I click on something, it will take several clicks for it to respond.

Me: Oh, I see. Are you sure it’s not a mouse problem?

Skip: How could it be a mouse problem? You just move the mouse and click on the icons. It’s just not running the programs when I click on things.

ME: Well. I can hook it up and we can see if it has the same problem.

Skip: Ok, but you will see right a way that it’s a CPU problem. I’ve read enough about computer issues to know this is how a bad CPU starts.

I take the computer and hook it up to our evaluation station. Power the unit up and ask him to log in. Once we are at the desktop. I start clicking on icons to open programs. Items are starting and coming up fine. No issues. I asked him. Does it take a little bit of time before the problem starts? Skip is standing behind me, wondering why everything is working.

Skip: No, its, its been constant. Every time I start the computer it happens. What did you do to fix it?

Me: You watched everything I did. I honestly think you have a bad mouse. The button is likely failing, which is why it’s not working every time.

Skip: I don’t believe that’s the real reason.

Me: Skip, you can see its working fine here. Sit down and give it a try.

Skip proceeds to move to the chair and starts opening and closing programs. Becoming more and more agitated that the problem has gone away.

I walk over to my parts shelf and grab a mouse out of the bin. And place it on the counter.

ME: I have this 5-dollar mouse. You are welcome to return it if you find out it doesn’t resolve the problem when you get it back home.

Skip: I still don’t see how it would be a mouse problem. But I will give it a try.

I power off his system, unhook the PC, and complete the transaction for the new mouse. I didn’t see Skip for a few weeks after that. When he came in the next time. I asked him how the new mouse was working. He just mumbled something and then asked for a new USB stick. So glad I can make a customer happy."

So when I get in today there is a customer who is doing a very complicated return with a coworker. She has multiple receipts and some items were bought in store and other items were bought online.

In the end she has 10 items that cannot be found on any of the receipts or her credit card. The coworker tries to process those items as a non-receipted return to get the customer a store credit. 

Unfortunately the item is blacklisted. Normally these items are expensive or easily stolen and cannot be returned without a receipt. The coworker explains that and the customer is upset.

At this point I’m totally on the customer side. It sucks that honest people I have to get stuck with items because other people steal. 

Customer asked for a manager. The manager comes up and says that they understand but there is no way to override the system. The customer wants another manager. The store manager was in the building that day and came and told the customer the same thing.

However the manager offers to look into it to make sure it wasn’t an online order. The customer leaves the items and says that when find her online order to credit her card and give her a call.

Here’s where the script gets flipped. Someone takes a look at the items in question. Like a real look at it. The product was in packaging for let’s call it GatorGrips. However the product inside of it was a half inch PVC elbow. So basically they were trying to return a .40 item for $10. 

He called her back and said that we returned her 10 count of elbows for her. Her account was credited $2.50."

A lady comes into my store asking for tire chains for her sons BMW. She has the tire size, and I check and sell her some ""Z"" rated cable chains made for the tire size and approved for the vehicle (PLT: You have to check the owners manual to see what kind of chains you can use!). 

She goes out the door a happy customer after I explain how to install them (also included instructions).

Fast forward a week. I get a phone call from that lady. Her son's BMW, is trashed. She says the cables were faulty and snapped and the cables have done significant damage to the car. The car is stuck out of state with her son however. I tell her if the chains are at fault I can help her, and provide her another copy of the receipt as the original is with her son. She says she will be there shortly.

So she shows up about an hour later and shows me pictures of the car, it's probably a total. The cables snapped off the rear driver wheel and whipped around the outside of the car. The cables reached from the rear driver side all the way to the trunk. It looks like you took a giant wire brush to the side of it, and the sheet metal is badly damaged too. Ouch.

So I print her off another copy of the receipt and put her in contact with the chain company and she goes out the door.

She comes back two days later, pretty upset. She says the chain company is pushing back, want the chains sent, chains had to be cut off the car and are already gone. She has her son on the phone with her when she came in.

I try to tell her there isn't much else I can do, and when I do, her son demands to speak with me. Sure?

Son: Why can't you help us out here? We bought these from you!

Me: You did, but this is a manufacturer issue at this point, I've done what I can.

Son: Oh. Well, I think you guys should be handling this, since we bought them there.

As was the case in a bunch of my other stories this takes place in the wonderful 5 years when I worked in a certain supermarket.  This particular story takes place on the most horrible, nerve racking, and anger inducing time of the year; November. It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, our Black Friday sales hit Thanksgiving day, late into the evening, around 9 or 10 oclock. To save time on the actual day of, they set up the displays for Blackfriday on this particular Wednesday. With everyone going for last minute Thanksgiving supplies, and the clutter this results in a lot of traffic in the aisles, a lot of angry customers, and just a lot of headaches for staff.

&#x200B;

Around this time a customer (Hereto after referred to as EC) comes up to my check out and starts loading things up. The first item I scan is a blanket of some kind, I don't remember exactly. Fleece I think. It comes up at the standard price and the customer immediately catches it.

EC: Hold on! That was supposed to be \[Heavily discounted price\]

Me: \*knowing I won't be able to change it quite that much on my own I immediately call for management, but I know it's going to take a while given how hectic it is\* I'm sorry, but that's not what it says here.

EC: Well what it says there is wrong! It's supposed to be \[Discounted price\] not that!

Me: Well I'm sorry, that's not how it's coming up in the system.

Ec: \*getting red in the face\* Well your system is wrong! You need to fix it right now!

Me: Ma'am, please calm down, I'm trying to get management over here to fix this

EC: Don't you dare tell me to calm down! This is ridiculous! There's so many people here I could hardly move through the store! What the hell is going on here!

Me: Well, ma'am, they're all trying to get their last minute shopping done so they don't have to come in during the holiday tomorrow.

EC: \*scoffs\* That's just stupid! They should've gotten all that done before!

Me: \*can't help but notice she has a cart full of food; cranberry sauce, corn, carrots, some potatoes, butter, pretty much a whole thanksgiving spread save the turkey\* Yeah...I guess...

EC: \*Eyes narrow, seeming to get exactly what I'm thinking but my manager arrives to save me, keep in mind I have a large line growing behind this woman now and the only thing I've scanned is the blanket\*

M: What's going on here?

EC: This BOY refuses to give me the proper price for this!

Me: She's saying it's down to \[Price\] but I knew I'd need approval to get it that low.

M: That doesn't sound right at all...can you tell me where you found it for that?

EC: It's back there! \*She points behind her in a general direction\*

M: \*sighs\* Me, why don't you go follow her to where it is, I'll put this stuff back in the cart and try to take care of the line.

Me: \*thinking she gave me the short end of the stick here, reluctantly nod and follow EC\*

EC: \*takes me through the aisles to one the big red displays that says 'Black friday savings!"" along with the item and the discounted price. We keep these under plastic wrap until just before the actual sale and attached to the plastic wrap on each side is no less than three signs saying ""Do not open until \[sale date\]"". The one she leads me to has a huge rip in plastic wrap\* See! This is where I got it

Me:...Ma'am, did you open this display?

EC: Of course! How else was I supposed to get at it!

Me:....Ma'am, that's for tomorrow's sale, that's why it's wrapped up like that, because it's not meant to be sold at that price today.

Me: \*quietly points to both the top part of the display, and the white signs on the plastic\* We do

EC: Well...thats...I mean...Ugh!

She stomps off to complain to my manager again while I flag down one of the stockers to get the hole patched. I don't know what happened after that, she was gone by the time I got back to the front, and I dismissed it. Apparently she had said that she'd come back during the sale though, didn't come back for a week because 'it was just so busy during the sale!' and threw another fit for not being allowed to purchase it at sale price after Black friday, though I wasn't present for any of that so I can't personally vouch for it.

“ when will he be here?”

“ I’m not sure but like in 10-20 mins”

“Okay I’ll be back later I need to return something”

He says “ well I bought a bag for £7.99 and it’s completely ripped on the inside. 

I’ve already seen This bag and he’s ripped it himself so then I say” okay do you have a receipt “

“ no I lost it “

So then I say “ we can’t return it”

And I repeat myself.

He gets more annoyed and then says “ where’s the boss. That’s the only person I NEED”

So I say okay I’ll call him and see what he says”

So I dial his number and speak to him and the manger says no. 

I tell the guy of the mangers decision and this person gets angry and says” I want you to return it now “

This story happened last night. I work at a clothing store in Florida. Everyone is panicking over Hurricane Dorian and gas stations and grocery stores are packed. We only had a few customers in last night, and it was near closing (we close at 9 PM).

I happened to be near the registers at the time (the registers are to the right of the front door) and my co-worker who just started working there recently was ringing up a customer. It was maybe 30 minutes until we were closing. This is around the time that we leave only one register open as it's not too busy out and everyone wants to leave early.

IC: ""Can you open up a register? We've been waiting for ten minutes."" (They weren't)

Me: ""Unfortunately we have only one register open, sir. She's almost done with the transaction and she'll be right with you.""

IC huffs and looks visibly frustrated.

Me: ""I apologize, sir, but we have no other registers open. You'll have to be patient.""

IC is fuming at this point and he slams the money down on the counter of a closed register infront of me and then he starts ripping the tag off the hat and starts to leave. I stop him by calling him over.

Me: (laughing internally over how ridiculous this is) ""Sir, I cannot allow you to leave with that. The payment has to be made through the register so the transaction is processed electronically."" (And also to cover my ass because I can get fired for letting him do that.)

IC: ""F*** it, then!"" He takes his money back and slams the hat on the counter and storms out the door.

He did seem pretty drunk but I don't even know what his problem is. He has all the time in the world to get his water, bread, alcohol, whatever he wants to get for this hurricane. I guess he won't have a hat then."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cx7b81/a_customer_just_screamed_at_me_for_20_minutes/,"A customer just screamed at me for 20 minutes. Over 90 cents. Literally typing this on my lunch break because I am so infuriated and disgusted by this lady, who for obvious reasons, I will be calling “Karen.”

One of my jobs is at a popular Hardware store that I shall not name as per the rules of this sub. However I will mention that I am a seasonal associate and my last shift is tomorrow.

Anyhow, I work as a cashier there and today I was assigned to the lumber register, a register way at the far end of the store and pretty far from everything else.

I was patiently awaiting customers when Karen arrived. She and her husband were buying nine 6-foot deck boards and three 12-foot deck boards. I scanned them in and she noticed they didn’t come up discounted. I flipped through the flyer to see that they are indeed supposed to be discounted for 15% off, it just wasn’t coming up in the system for some reason.

No biggie. This happens more frequently that it should. I’ll just manually override it. Except that wouldn’t work. I got a pop-up on my POS screen stating that because of the store’s relationship with the vendor, they can’t sell the boards for less than full price. I sent for one of the assistant managers and she helped me work around it and override it for the discount. Everything was fine.

Then I went to give her the total and she suddenly stops. She says the 6-foot deck boards were coming up as $6.98 at full price, rather than $6.86. I was confused because with the discount, that should equal $5.93 and I was already giving that to her.

She sends her husband to check and I asked if a lumber associate could verify it. There was a tag that read “$6.86” however not only was it a completely different type of board, it also explicitly states that they are $6.86 minus 10%. Not 15%. $6.86 minis 10% would have rung them up at $6.17. I informed them that what I was giving them for the boards was cheaper than what was labelled on the tag.

However, Karen informs me she wants $6.86 minus 15% rather than 10%. Essentially she wanted me to combine both offers. I politely told her I can’t do that because it’s a completely different item. 

And then the gates of Hell were opened. She started screaming at me, the assistant manager, and the associate with me about not getting her damn discount (even though she was already getting one). She would. Not. Back. Down. All three of us were trying to explain it to Karen only for her to interrupt us and continue screaming about how she’s never coming her again, she’d rather go to our competitor, yada yada yada. I think all of us here have heard it all before. 

This onslaught of demonic screeching went on for close to 20 minutes. While the assistant manager tries to reason with Karen, I pop the numbers into the equation. 

Here’s what I found out:

$6.98 x .85 = $5.93 (Full price in system minus 15%)

$6.86 x .90 = $6.17 (Full price of the incorrect tag minus its listed 10%)

Now I thought let’s pretend I actually gave her the combined offer and gave her $6.86 minus 15% instead of 10%, like she wanted.

$6.86 x .85 = $5.83 (Literally 10 cents less than the discount she was already getting) 

Eventually the assistant manager just gives up and gives her the 15% off of $6.86.

Now referring back to what she was buying, she had 9 of those deck boards. If she was saving 10 cents on each one, she was literally screaming in our faces over 90 cents. *Ninety cents.*

I was so pissed off when she left. The greed of people disgusts me.

I came *this* close to going off and screaming back at her because like I said, my contract is almost over and my final shift is tomorrow. Even if I did scream at her, what are they gonna do? Fire me? 

The worst part was she came back and she had the **BALLS** to ask me to use my measuring tape and stapler to measure the boards and make sure they were correct and to staple on a red flag which you have to legally put on if you’re carrying wood in an open-bedded truck. 

I’m honestly proud of myself that I somehow resisted committing second-degree murder."

Everything is pandemonium, but I'm stocking a shelf across from my co worker who's also stocking shelves. We're talking about general hurricane preparedness when a lady overheard, and looks at me and asks ""how much gas do I need to run my generator during the hurricane?"", to which I replied ""I don't know mam"". She relied "" well it's a rental, and it was one of the medium teir ones"" to which I replied"" I still do not know mam, perhaps you can call the place you rented it from?"". She didn't seem to like that answer, but she gave a huff and kept moving with the crowd. So yeah, if you work in Florida, go ahead and memorize all makes and models of generators,  and their gas consumption."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cwx9i4/you_should_really_know_your_stock_better/,"""You should really know your stock better."" A couple years ago, I was a cashier at a small store which sold accessories, decorating, and DIY crafting materials. When this happened, I had worked there for about three months. I knew the items we sold pretty well, but I didn't quite know every shelf like the back of my hand yet. I had already put in a lot of effort to learn the stock, though.

I'm the only employee around when Karen walks in, and our registers are right next to the front doors, so Karen comes up to me.

Karen: ""Where do you keep your beads?""

Me: ""I'm sorry, ma'am. To my knowledge, we don't carry beads.""

K: ""You do. I know you do. My friend told me that she bought beads here before.""

I knew full well that we didn't carry beads, but I didn't feel like getting into it with Karen.

Me: ""If we do, they'll be in \[X aisle\].""

She goes over to that aisle and comes back to my register after a bit -- carrying a few items, none of which are beads.

K: ""You were right, I didn't find any beads.""

Me: ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience."" I continue to ring her up.

K: ""You should really get to know your stock better.""

Now I'm confused. Did she just call me ignorant for correctly telling her that we didn't carry an item??

K: ""Next time you're working, you should come in early, off the clock, to browse the store and familiarize yourself with what you sell.""

I'm fuming, but I knew I'd get in trouble if I defended myself to her. I manage to get out a ""Yes, ma'am,"" but I'm pretty sure I'm turning red in the face.

She walked out, and I spent the rest of the day telling her off in my head.

TL;DR: I correctly told a Karen that we didn't sell an item, and she told me that I should learn the store's stock better."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cx75bn/trading_standards/,"""TrAdINg StANdaRdS"" Okay so this happened a while ago but I saw the person the other day and it reminded me of it.

So I worked in a vape shop for about two years, about a year into this job, a customer comes in complaining about a vape saying it is not charging and she can't get a drag off it, she puts it on the counter with the receipt, I pick it up, take one look at it and instantly see another companies branding on the device. 

I place it back down on the counter and explain to her that she didn't buy it from us, straight away she gets defensive and hits me with ""I definitely did buy it from here! Look I've got the receipt!"" Again I explain to her that she bought it from another shop that was down the street. She is adamant that she bought it from us and hit with the ""I want to speak to the manager!"". Funny thing is, I was the person in charge that day, I explain this to her and she suddenly starts to go quiet, now I'm usually a level headed person but she kept up with this whole ""I did buy it from here!"" I literally had to take her outside, show her our company logo compared to the logo on the device. Once realising that she was in the wrong she apologised and left soon after. 

Cut to three weeks later, shes back again with a device she did actually buy from us complaining that its having the same problems, now I worked for a franchise and our company policy was that before we accept a return, we must test it for atleast two hours to find the exact fault. When I explained this to her. She was definitely not happy, demanding her money right then and I kept explaining to her that it's not possible and I'd be risking disciplinary action if I dont follow company policy. She picked the device from the counter, stormed out shouting ""I'm getting trading standards involved"". About five minutes later, she comes back in and asks if we can test it and if theres a shop phone that she can ring and check on the progress. Never saw her again. 

I met some right characters whilst working in the vape shop and just writing this has brought back some other stories and I'll be posting them soon."

I used to work at a Canadian Tire (Yeah, I'm a Canadian boi) for nearly 2 years. I worked in the sports and tools section, even though I knew jack squat about each but hey, gotta make that cash. Now a little tidbit about Canadian Tire, we didn't all sell firearms for the longest time, and it was nearly after a year of me working there that we finally got our first hunting rifle. We did have an aisle though which had one side consisting of glass cases full of slingshots, paintball guns, airsoft guns and the like, the other side being full of fishing rods.

So this fella decides to show up in this buisnay. If I remember, he had a jacket and hat from Browning and a beard that went down to his chest, with some strands of grey. Probably in his 40's. He was checking out the glass cases and had a face like 'Huh... is this it? That can't be possibly true' so I decided to approach my red shirt ass over and ask the classic proverb 'Need help with anything sir?'

(C)ustomer: Yeah, I got a question for you

(M)e: Sure, what's up?

C: So uh... where do you keep them?

He gave me that look like ""Yeah, you get me, bro?"" as if I was gonna give the fingerguns and be like ""Yeeeeaaaaah man!"" but I had no idea what he meant. Did he not see the cases?

M: \*glances at glass cases\* Uh.. keep these?

C: No no no, where do you keep... the REAL guns?

This is when it hit me; he thought we sold real fire arms. Well, not like he is the first to ask so I gave our normal answer that we didn't sell real fire arms. He actually makes a chuckle, takes a step to me, and practically whispers. Stranger danger!

C: They behind the counter? Maybe in the back?

Wow.

M: No sir, we do not sell firearms

C: So who do I have to talk to here to purchase myself a gun? Maybe a manager?

Just wow.

M: No. Dude. We don't have real guns here.

C: Is it like, some kind of membership

This guy.

This dude, was actually going to pay me to go get someone to sell him a non-existent gun that we do not have the capacity to sell to him!! Not like he was high or drunk, I got a sensitive smell so I could have smelled it if he was. Eventually, I was like 'aight' and called over my manager. She showed up, and he gave her the same spiel about wanting a gun. She had to explain to him like... twice, that we do not sell real firearms. After that, he finally got the idea, and left the store. My manager gave me this wide eyed look at me as if saying 'Was he for real?'

Did this dude think we had a black market of fire arms in the back or something?

Edit: He had a BEARD, not a BREAD."

For a while, I worked at a Canadian Wholesale with my best friend (rare, yes). It was probably my favorite job ever and if the pay was higher, I most likely would have never left. It was a downer time when I left, but my friend always tells me whats up at work, since I miss the people and want the store to succeed. 

One day, I'm hanging out with my bud, and he tells me about this crazy customer he got one evening shift. Now at this Canadian wholesale, there aren't many employees and at the late evening, the store becomes pretty dead. The only sound are carts that the workers use, and the radio that plays the same 6 songs over and over (God, I hate that radio).

My friend was working in the bathroom supplies aisle when he noticed an old woman pushing a cart. He described her as hunched over and wearing a yellow bonnet. She approached him and asked if he knew where the bath salts were, which were right next to her. Haha, common mistake.

She decided to pat his shoulder and say 'thanks sonny', which made my bud nearly laugh.

As she was on her way out, after picking up some salts, another woman was walking down the aisle, a younger one. She tried to get by the old lady, but there, for some reason, is a pillar in the aisle, which takes up a third of the width. She accidently bumped the corner where the handle was and my friend claims this old woman, hunches over a bit more and HISSES AT THE LADY.

I assumed he meant like a hissy comment, but he said she out right hissed like a rabid animal. The young woman didn't even have time to apologize before this crazy hag made her way out. My friend and the woman had a little laugh.

Later though, the same old woman is searching for something in the aisle 2 away. My friend asked if she needed help and she asks for a supervisor. My friend called over the Supervisor, a pretty nerdy guy in his late 20's. He goes to help her and he does, finding a product. She then looks at him and asks him if he is married yet. He tells her, with a laugh, he isn't even dating someone.

This woman decides to go full Grandma and starts saying things like ""You must! Find a nice girl! Have children! Make your mother proud and make her some grand children!""

The supervisor was trying SO HARD not to laugh.

The lady left after that and my friend says they still talk about that encounter in the back office."

Customer with young child comes up wanting to buy something and she hands me some cash with the product. While I'm scanning, she pulls out a gift card and says ""I'll also pay with this. There's $25 on it, I think."" I say okay, complete the transaction and hand her the receipt. I also mention that there's still $4 on her gift card that she can use for her next purchase. 

Customer: Can I get that $4 off the gift card?

Me: Gift cards can't be redeemed for cash but you can spend the $4 on something else in store.

Customer: But I'm not coming here again. Why would I want to spend it here? I just want the $4 in change.

Me: Oh ok. It would have been best to tell me that before I processed the gift card and finalised the transaction. I can't really go back and adjust that now, sorry. 

Customer: But I wanted that money, it should have clicked y'know.

Me: Again, I had no way of knowing and it's best to let me know that beforehand. Our customers will normally use their gift card next time they're in. 

Customer: -mumbles something with a scowl while stepping away-

Me: Sorry? What was that?

She continued to mumble something and walked off. 

And then! A few minutes later, a teenager came in to buy something and used that exact same gift card that I wrote the remaining balance of $4 onto. She mentioned that her mum was in earlier so that customer from before gave her the gift card to use. I wonder how that conversation went down."

I ring her up and offer to put them on for her, because she's very polite, and she accepts. I go outside, to see something amazing. Her car, is amazingly new looking. Not a scratch, a ding, no oxidation, it's beautiful.

I pull the old wipers off and glance inside and the interior is the same, showroom condition! I mention it to her as I'm changing them.

Me: Wow, this car is in amazing shape! I've never seen one this well maintained, good for you!

Lady: Well thank you. I do keep it in the garage and the dealer does take care of it, but it does only have 20,000 miles on it.

Me: O.O 

Me: Wait. If it has that low of miles, how long has the rear wiper not worked?

She gets in and hits the switch and the arm *moves* but only a half inch and the wiper blade doesn't move at all? Like the rubber *stretches* but doesn't move?

She does and I reach out and grab it. The arm moves fine. The rubber, has melted/welded itself to the glass!

Me: Have... have you *ever* changed this?!

Lady: Oh.... Well, no, I don't think I have. \*laughs\*

I had to **cut/scrape** the old blade off the window with a razor and then cleaned off the leftovers with some solvent. Put on a new blade and it worked great.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cwscxa/please_use_paper_bags_whenever_possible/,"Please use paper bags whenever possible. Today, we ran out of paper bags. This is largely in part of one of my coworkers, who is always trying to do her part for the environment. Every customer she rings up: “Would you like paper or plastic?” If they don’t care, she goes with paper. I completely support this, even though it’s kind of a pain to bag for her. She is very passionate about minimizing waste and recycling.

Except, today our manager came in to tell her she isn’t allowed to offer a choice anymore. Only bust out paper if she is specifically asked to. According to our sympathetic manager, corporate has asked that we don’t use paper bags without being asked to specifically, since they are more expensive. If we want to be more environmental, we can suggest they buy a reusable bag.

Here’s the kicker: this coworker informed me that many people have said they would have used paper bags if they knew we had them. They are hidden from the public eye. Literally, they are kept in a hard-to-see place under the checkstands, you can’t see them.

So I am telling everybody: since we aren’t allowed to ask for your preference, this is a general statement: We have paper bags. A lot of grocery stores do, even if it isn’t obvious. Please ask for your groceries in paper if you can. If not for the environment, then do it to stick it to the greedy corporate jerks. Tell your friends! I’m going to ask for paper whenever I shop now, just because we aren’t allowed to tell people that we have them while they’re checking out.

Edit: I should clarify that I live in a state where grocery bags are free. Apparently that is not as common as I thought it was."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cwkdsq/no_you_cant_park_in_the_fire_lane/,"No, you can't park in the fire lane This happened a few months ago when we still had our former store manager (FSM).  We have issues with customers parking just wherever.  3 of our parking rows have disabled parking at the end closest to the store.  Anything past those spaces are the driving lanes.  People will park 4 deep and only leave enough room for one car to squeeze past.  They also park in the fire lane which blocks access to propane, ice, the outdoor garden area, etc.

Our FSM would not let us confront customers and ask them to move or inform them they're in a no parking zone.  Instead he would have us call the nonemergency police number and have them ticketed and towed.  

I was exiting the garden area after a break.  Lady stopped me.  

HER: Can I park here while I run inside to pay for these flowers and grab a few other things?

ME: Ma'am I can't tell you you can't park here but I can tell you if you do, someone from customer service will be calling the police and you will be ticketed and towed.  

HER: What?   Can I or not?

ME:  Again, I cannot tell you that you can or can't park here but I can tell you if you do, the police will come, you will be given a ticket of around $125, towed for about $90, and each day your car is in the impound lot is $85.

HER:  Quit talking in riddles and just answer me.

ME: I cannot tell you where you can and cannot park.  I can only tell you that if you park there you will be ticketed and towed.

HER: Is it so g**damned hard to answer a question???  Can. I. Park. Here?

ME:  Ma'am please listen to me carefully.  I cannot, as in I'm not allowed to, tell you that you cannot park here.  What I can tell you is if you park anywhere that is not a clearly marked parking space, as designated by the white lines, and park here, in the fire lane which is marked yellow and has no parking signs every 4 ft, store policy is to call the police.  If your car is parked in a clearly marked no parking zone, you will get a ticket that is usually around $125.  The police will then call for a tow.  They will charge you $90 for the tow.  Then on top of that, you cannot retrieve your car until the ticket and the tow fee are paid.  They will charge you $85 each day your car is impounded.  Now, if it is worth $300 minimum to park in a clearly marked no parking zone, by all means, stay.  I'm not allowed to tell you not to park there.  

HER: heads in to shop.

ME: straight to the service desk to call it in.  

She came out to find her car being pulled onto the tow truck.  Of course after screaming at the police, she came in to yell at me that my answer was too vague.  FSM took over at this point.

FSM: Ma'am, were there signs that said no parking?  Then that's all that's needed.  I don't allow my employees to risk injury by being ran over by someone mad when they are told they can't park somewhere.  Now have a pleasant day.

Yes, she called corporate.  NSM policy is to nicely inform them they cannot park here, then call the police if they refuse to move..  2 people have already just avoided being hit.  I think I like old policy better."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cwq3xa/we_only_come_for_the_free_nights_so_have_fun/,"""We Only Come For The Free Nights, SO Have Fun Losing Our Business"" So at my local firearms store we also have our own firing range and we tend to have a lot of cool deals for customers. Honestly, it's amazing that we still keep it running because our deals are pretty generous but the main store kind of keeps it afloat. One of those deals is that on Wednesdays, ladies, veterans, and local law enforcement get to shoot for ""free"". I put quotations because it used to be free until (surprise, surprise) the store found that it wasn't making much money from that; so it got revised to if you fit that category and had a purchase of $10 or more in the range, you're shooting lane would be free. That's still not bad considering that a box of ammo is usually $10-$15 at its cheapest anyway. If a woman or officer happened to bring a friend with them, the friend is to pay the full price of $15 as opposed to a guest usually paying $5 if the main shooter payed his or her full $15 for the lane.

Well, some of the guys who worked at the range part of the store had a hard time getting the memo of the transition, so there were a few issues of certain people still shooting for free without paying the minimum balance (management isn't really great in the range but I'll spare that rant). So naturally my department of the store's customer service has to deal with whatever issues come from there. Well about three months after we made this change I had this couple come up to my service desk Wednesday night.

Me: Hi sir! Is there anything I can help you with?

Male: Yes, you see me and my girlfriend come here to this store all the time. We tend to shoot on Wednesdays for date night and we usually love it here. But You're guys at the range informed me that we have to spend $10 here to get our free lane.

Me: Yes sir, it's a change we made quite a while ago. The family who runs this place decided that they still need at least some purchase to be made to keep the range running on Wednesdays since it's so popular.

Male: Well this is unacceptable! We've always shot here for free. My fiance and I have always given you business and this is how customers are treated? There has to be some mistake! My fiance didn't have to pay on her last visit, and I only had to pay $5.

Me: I'm sorry sir but that's not supposed to be our policy. We have some new guys there, and I think they were confused about how the pricing works. Since her lane was free, you're to pay the full price for your lane since you are technically the first ""paying"" shooter. I apologize for the misinformation, however the gentlemen in the range today are enforcing the proper policy.

Fiance: I can't believe this. You guys are so dishonest!

Me: ?????

Male:Well you know what? You guys just lost our business! We've supported your range for this long but if that's how things are, we'll just go elsewhere!

Me: Alrighty then sir! I hope you have a great night!

After that I looked this guy up in our system and he doesn't really buy much from us anyway. Just the necessary ammo. Not guns or anything; so honestly I don't care about some freeloader going elsewhere and neither did my managers."

She comes back and she’s actually really nice and polite when I explain what happened. So I follow her up to the register and she actually starts telling the cashier what happened and saying it was her fault I messed up.

Idiot: ""I bought gas here earlier today and drove to Tennessee and now I'm out of gas. I want a refund.""

Me: ""Well we don't give refunds on gas and you drove pretty far. You've probably just used it all.""

Idiot: ""There must of been something wrong with the gas. I'm on the side of the road and my car is empty. What are you gonna do about it?""

Me: ""There's nothing I can do. If you want to argue then you can call the main store and see if they'll tell you something different.""

Idiot: ""No I want to talk to you and work something out."" 

This is when a very impatient customer showed up and did not want to wait for me to finish my phone call and proceeded to bang on the glass and yell that she wanted gas. I told the man to wait just a second for me to start the pump for this lady. When I picked up the phone again I noticed he had hung up."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cwcj7e/couple_travel_far_to_store_after_misreading/,"Couple travel far to store after misreading website, blames company when they realise Hi guys! Thought I'd tell you about the most memorable customers I've had in the last couple years I've worked in retail. First, I need to give some context - it'll be important later.

So I work in a urban sports store (skateboards, stunt scooters, etc) in a small town, so naturally our stock isn't anything compared to the other store in the franchise, which has a massive warehouse with all our stuff. Most sales come from the website the bigger store operates, so patrons come in thinking we have that particular item when we don't. We offer to order it in from the warehouse and have it delivered to us in a few days but as you'd expect, people aren't aware of this and are often pretty disappointed. To try and combat this, we asked head office to put a notice on our's store page on the website, to call ahead to check, and order it in if needed. Simple? Of course not.

So it was around 5pm yesterday afternoon a couple walked in, and I had that gut feeling that they were gonna be pain in the ass. They walked around the small storefront (and I mean small, some living rooms are bigger than our store) mumbling to each other in confusion, until they walked over to the counter. Let's call him Richard (R) and myself (M):
    
> M: Hi there! How can I help?

> R: Hi, we came in to buy a pair of ice skates for my kid?

> M: Oh sorry, we don't stock ice skates in this store unfortunately. However, we do have many on our website that you can have ordered to your house on one-day delivery. If you're local, we can order them in to get here in the next couple days.

> R: Excuse me?! We've driven two hours, from [place that's quite far away] to get these skates because your store lied to us! This is not acceptable.
    
We've had customers visit wanting ice skates before, specifically figure skating ones, however they were all local & few and far between. The nearest ice rink is miles away, and due to the low interest we don't stock them. However, I found it very fishy that they said they were lied to, so I probed further.

> M: Oh wow, I'm really sorry to hear that! Who told you that we had them?

> R: Your website! It says on the page on your store! I'm going to post all about this on social media! This is awful from [brand].

Awesome! A place to dig - maybe head office made messed up and said we stocked them. I head to the page and read the bio - nothing on ice skates. Even said to call us to check. Cool, they either misread or are lying to cover their back. But, they were already irate and I hadn't lost enough of the will to live to call them out on it. I eventually calmed them down (like, the littlest bit) and told them I'll talk to my manager later about this (I was the only one in at the time), and told them where the nearest skates could be bought; to be fair they were an hour away and would be closed by then. When they realised they weren't gonna get anything, they had a mini-storm out the store. After I had a small five minute ""what the fuck just happened"" break, I dm'd my manager what happened and I forgot about it.

Earlier today, I came into work to support a stock delivery (no ice skates, unfortunately) and filled in my colleague (C) on what happened. After finishing, and waiting for a customer to come in - it was a Tuesday early afternoon after all  - I notice a notification coming from the store slack account. I clicked to see what it was and the mad lad Richard left a comment on a post on the company's social media account. I won't put what he said, since it's quite identifiable but to paraphrase, it wasn't exactly PG-13.

The pair of us had a good laugh, especially at the comments on the slack message (e.g ""why did he not just call ahead"" etc, etc). What I didn't notice was C saw the guys handle and looked through his profile. Dear god, I have never seen another human bitch and moan like this one did. I think at one point he complained the french fries at a supermarket cafeteria was burnt (they were crispy at best from the picture he posted). Oh yea, there was so much right-wing stuff it was insane. Later my manager got in contact with head office, and confirmed my end of the story.

Afterwards, we found out later on google maps that there were two figure skate stores in the city he came from. Intelligence 100.

I've had a few interesting customers in the last few years in retail, but holy hell was a heck of a saga. Hope you guys had a laugh as well.

tl;dr - couple drove hours to store because they misread website, have a mini-meltdown, rants to social media page, laughed at."

While ringing up a customer yesterday (I work at a grocery/department store) she told me she loves coming through my line because I'm always so efficient, helpful, etc.  So I thanked her and told her that was really nice to hear. Then towards the end of my shift, the owner of a local sports bar and grill came through my line and said, ""Hey, there's my favorite cashier!""  I've rung him up many times over the years, but this is the first time he verbally told me that he likes it when I'm the one who rings him up. Gotta say, those two compliments probably helped me get through my day.  I really do try to make it a point to get to know my regulars while still being friendly to those I haven't developed such rapports with yet. Therefore, it's always nice when someone sees the effort you put in to provide great service, and on top it that, tells you to your face how much they appreciate you.  Comments/compliments like this helps sustain me after dealing with rude people, idiots, etc.  Am definitely thankful for my friendly customers and regulars!"

Had one customer, lady in her 50's. I admit I was kind of cranky because I slept badly lastnight, but she just compounded on the problem with kind of a nasty attitude (or maybe thats what it felt to me). On top of that, another lady 30 min before that was ""super busy and in a hurry"", that just left her things in the counter and took off, because we had the *audacity* of not taking care of her, ahead of people who arrived before.

Well, then comes a third lady, around 20 min after the second one. You couldnt picture a more grandma-like person. She immediatly put me in a good mood with her grandmother aura skill, max level. She was asking for a product (a type of candy, going to assume for her grandchildren), but after a couple of minutes of describing and searching, she was getting the names mixed and it was another type of candy. We just laughed, and Im still kinda, hours later.

Thats it. Thank the world for that woman."

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cw3e0k/how_do_you_know_if_something_is_or_is_not_a_book/,"How do you know if something is or is not a book? The other day I had to really hold back my laughter when I overheard my coworker dealing with a nuisance customer. Last week there was a coupon in some newspapers that gave customers £5 off their transaction if they were spending £20 or over on books, stationary or greetings cards. The print on the coupon very clearly stated what it could NOT be used on.

So in the afternoon I noticed a paper-craft magazine left behind the till, and my coworker tells me someone has rang up asking for it. About an hour later this person came in to buy it. I was putting stock out near the till, and this is what I heard:

Customer: ""Excuse me, I called earlier about a magazine? A craft magazine.""

Coworker: ""Oh yes, is this the one you asked for?""

Customer: ""...is that the newest issue? It looks like the last issue.""

Coworker: ""Let me just check on my scanner...yeah this issue came out two weeks ago but the next one isn't out until next week according to this.""

Customer: ""Oh right...well I'll get it in case I haven't got it already. I have a coupon...""

As she produced the coupon my coworker immediately noticed it was the £5 off £20 one, and told the customer it won't work on such a small transaction.

Coworker: ""Oh that coupon will only work if you're spending £20 or more, this magazine is only £9.99.""

Customer: ""It says £5 off.""

Coworker: ""Yeah £5 off any transaction over £20 of books, stationary or greetings cards. If you have a look around maybe there's something else you might like that will bring it up?""

Customer: ""What about a few of those books? Two or three of them is probably about £10 right?""

Coworker: ""These are all new books, this is the paperback chart. They range from £7.99 to £9.99.""

Customer: ""What! £7.99 for a book? That's a bit much, especially for paperbacks!""

I'm stood there thinking hold on, your magazine is more than that for less content...She decided to have a quick look around the shop for something else, but didn't get very far before my coworker suddenly realised! Magazines are excluded from the coupon! Whoops, better quickly tell the customer.

Coworker: ""Excuse me! Sorry, I've just double checked the coupon fine print, magazines aren't actually included in the offer. It's ONLY books, stationary and greetings card.""

Customer: ""Well this is a book.""

Coworker: ""It's a magazine.""

Customer: ""Magazines are books though.""

Coworker: ""I know what you mean but they are classed as different types of products.""

Customer: ""Well that doesn't mean its not a book.""

Coworker: ""But its a magazine. Its not classed as a book.""

Customer: ""Well if its not a book what would YOU call it???""

Coworker: ""...a magazine.""

Customer: ""Oh whatever I just want this stupid thing forget the coupon.""

So she bought her magaz-sorry, she bought her book and left. Hopefully she'll be back next week to buy some fountain pens with our 3 for 2 deal on pencils."

I work in a wine shop, and this softly spoken, well dressed, middle-aged man came in. He approached my young, female colleague (relevant info because I think he thought he was being edgy to impress her or something) and asked her to recommend a wine. 

She picked one out, described it and led him to the till. So far so normal. He pays, then blurts out, in the same soft spoken voice: “I better like this wine or I’ll come back and cut your throat.” 

We just stood there in shock for a second before she nervously responded: “I really hope you like it, so...”

Now, I have a dark sense of humour, but this guy was a new customer - he’d never even met my colleague, so he certainly didn’t have the kind of rapport you’d need to say something like that. 

I just hope he was actually joking."

I scan his purchases, ask would he like a bag letting him know we charge 1p per bag. He just nods his head, I bag up his magazines, and then the fun begins.

“So that’s a total of £X.XX” I said clearly

“What?” He replied looking confused. I quickly realise he might be hard of hearing, so I repeat myself but louder

“£X.XX!”

“What?” Again I have to repeat myself, but louder and slower.

“Its £X.XX!!” At this point my manager sticks her head around a corner, wondering what’s going on, sees me and the old man. She quickly puts two and two together, and seeing I have it handled goes back to doing her own work.

“Oh just take it from that” he replied throwing a random amount of money in the counter, I quickly count up the required amount and put into the till. He then collects the rest of his money and his change and then walks off, back into the store. I am thinking ‘oh he wants something else’. Oh how wrong I was, he goes down the aisle where my manager was, then storms out about 3 minutes later in a huff. My colleague comes over and she looks like she can barely keep herself from laughing her head off

“You won’t believe what that old man said to manager” me being curious asks to which I get the story

“Well he came over and asked manager, if she was the manager. Then when she confirmed it, said How Dare You have someone with learning difficulties on the till! I couldn’t understand a word he was saying! Manager flipped. One, he doesn’t have learning difficulties, we heard him clearly from over here, YOU have hearing difficulties, either get a hearing aid, or turn it bloody on. Secondly it doesn’t matter if someone has learning difficulties, as long as they can serve customers, and can do the job, that’s good enough for us, now get out of my store” both of us started laughing at this, me in shock, my colleague because of the wtf of it all.

Never saw that gentlemen again, probably didn’t like being told that he had hearing problems. Tell me what you think, and if you would like more stories, I have more ridiculous customer stories to share if anyone is interested."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cvvver/let_me_ruin_your_rating_because_you_were_busy/,"Let me ruin your rating because you were busy A couple of days a go I assisted a woman with updating her plans. Gave her an hour of my time for something that made our store very little. At the end I asked if she could please complete the survey she receives in her email and that a 10 means I've done my job right. 

These surveys are grossly scaled. Anything below a 9 is a detractor and lowers your commissions at the end of the month. These surveys also refer to their ”{company name} experience"" so people often rate the company not realising they're rating us. But this lady I specifically told it reflected on me. 

Yesterday she came back into the shop regarding an issue and my manager assisted her. I was with another customer but came to the front to grab them a charger. When there she said hi and I said hi and nodded back then left. 

This morning my manager opens their emails and boom she gave me a zero commenting ""All they care about is getting your money. No after sales service!""

This was my 12th survey of this month but because of scaling it caused me to drop 20/100 points. This potentially loses me hundreds of dollars in commision. So thank you cranky crone. Thank you for taking your frustration out on me and my minimum wage service.

Update:
Called her back to ask about how her connection went, she was really mad as its not working. Brought her back in-store and talked her through every step of getting her setup going. She was delighted but very pissed still about the previous day. She was mad at my manager for telling her to call up about the issue and mad at the person she got when she called up. Both gave her vague and unhelpful answers. 

When I asked if she had received a survey she stated yes and that she had said the initial transaction was fine but after sales was dreadful, mean in my manager. I assured her that regardless of intent, only the score reflects and it will solely be against me. 

She was very apologetic and has promised to try and remove it. I doubt she can but it does make me feel better knowing I was wrong thinking she did it against me out of spite."

I work the overnight cashier shift at a grocery store. I have come to hate it with a passion. It's much quieter but if something does go wrong I have pretty much nothing in the way of backup, and due to recent issues overnights are running on a complete skeleton crew.

This night was pretty normal, and so was this particular customer. At first. He got beer and when asked for ID pulled out his wallet without a fuss, which is always nice. He was having a lot of trouble, so I told him he didn't need to take it out as long as I could read the dates. I leaned forward slightly and then everything went wrong.

He glared at me and said, ""Do not look in my wallet."" I apologized and explained that that hadn't been my intention. Not good enough. He repeats that I am not to look in his wallet and I am not his wife (???). I apologized again. He finally got his ID out and showed it to me, reading his birth date in an incredibly angry voice. He honestly didn't seem drunk, just horrible, so I put it in without a word and hoped he would just leave.

He would. not. let. it. go. Kept saying I was not his wife (thank god!!) and that I had disrespected him. I was completely silent at this point. He was working himself into such a rage over my ""disrespect"" that I was actually starting to become afraid. Dude was over twice my size. A woman walked by and gave me a concerned look.

Finally he said, ""You do that again and you're going to get hurt.""

Aaaaand then I'd had enough. I whipped my head up and told him in a loud voice that he was not going to threaten me. Then I paged the crew chief while he screamed about how he didn't give a f\*\*\* who I called etc etc. Crew chief came before anything happened and tried to calm him down to no avail, but got him to agree to talk somewhere more private.

But not before the guy turned to me with a look of  utter hatred, said, ""Keep this, you trashy b\*\*\*\*"", and threw his receipt at my face.

So while I stood there using all of my willpower to stay put and remain calm, the woman from before came up. Turns out she'd called the cops and she wanted to check up on me and tell me they might stop by. I thanked her because I REALLY needed a reminder of the existence of basic human kindness. Seriously, thank you lady.

Crew chief came back and dismissed the guy as a drunk (let him have the beer though). He also let me know that the customer had said ""something even worse"" about me. I asked if it was the c-word and he said no and refused to tell me anything beyond that. He'd told the guy to have a good night and sent him on his way.

Yep. I very nearly walked out of there forever.  Too bad I need the money."

OK, so this happened last week, when I was supposed to be off for the week. I got a call on the Monday from my manager asking if I could cover for her on the Tuesday, as she was having problem walking due to an injury in her knee. I reluctantly agreed, as it was my dads birthday and had made plans. I went in the following morning and did absolutely nothing other than turn the till on until it was time to open. 

As soon as the clock hit 9 I opened the store and began looking at the jobs that were left for me to get done. The main job was again to get recall off the shop floor. I went through the recall list to see what shoes needed to be removed from the shop floor and started to take off some dolly shoes that were placed near the door. 

As I was taking off the shoes I hear some one say

""You're doing it again!""

I turn slightly and notice Karen outside the shop, glaring at me. 

me:""Excuse me?""

Karen: You're removing shoes!

Me:Yes their going back to the warehouse, so they can be sent to another store. We're not selling enough of them.

Karen: Well you won't sell them if you keep removing them. Put them back.

We hadn't sold a pair of these shoes in nearly a month hence why they were going back.

Me: I'm sorry this is part of my job, if you have a complaint, feel free to call customer services.

At this point I got an order from a customer on the till, placed the shoes in a tub and went to collect the customers order from the shop floor. I turn to go back to till to make sure I have everything for the order and see karen taking the shoes from the bucket. I mean all of them.

Me: Excuse me! can you please put those back in the tub

Karen: No I am putting them back, which should be your job. 

She sees the shoes and bag in my arms.

Karen: You're doing it again! How dare you remove more stuff!

Me: Someone has already payed for these, I'm making sure they don't get accidently sold.

Karen: I don't believe you, you don't have any proof.

Me: I do have proof, but it contains customer details, so I am unable to show it to you, as it is against the law and company policy

Karen: You're lying! Put those back right now!

I was getting fed up, I was in a bad mood already due to being in work when I was meant to be off again, but she was pushing me to my limit.

Me: No they belong to a customer and please can you put those shoes back in the bucket.

Karen: No, they belong where they were. Now put those items back or are you deaf as well as stupid

I ignored her accepted the order and put the items in a bag and stapled the receipt to bag. At this point I was torn whether to put the order in the back, or wait Karen out. Turns out I didn't have to do either. Karen dropped the shoes she was holding and tried to come behind the till.

Me: Excuse me, you can't come back here.

Karen: I'm just stopping you from removing stuff from the shop

She reaches for the customers bag, but I step between her and the bag.

Karen: Get out of my way! You can't even do you're job probably, that stuff belongs on the shelves!

Me: No it doesn't, it's been paid for already. 

Karen: You're lying!

She tries to push me aside, but there is not a lot of room so she fails miserably.

Luckily a centre cleaner was walking past, saw the commotion and went to get the centre manager, who we'll call G.

G came into the store and asked what was going on.

Karen: She's removing stuff from the displays!

G: She's well within her right to do that, if that's what she needs to do.

Karen: She's even lying about it. She's saying customers have bought things and is trying to removing them

I point to the bag on the floor, with the recipt clearly stapled to it.

G, asked Karen to go with him to his office.

I had to phone, my manager, area manager and notify customer services in case she phoned to complain. Which took all morning. Unfortunately the Police weren't called to this situation and she isn't banned from the center, but she is banned from the store. I hope it's over."

crunch

He stopped his stride and looked down at his shoe. A poor little bat just got smooshed. I swear I felt bad for the bat, despite it being a pest in a retail store. Not a pleasant way to go.

""No kidding... that the first time that's ever happened?""

""Yeah. Never had a bat sneak in here before. Birds, sure. But not bats.""

I shrugged and recalled something I had said earlier to him when he was telling me I might not head to the back often. I had said that you never know what will happen or if you need to head to the back.

""Always expect the unexpected."" He smiled at that and laughed at the blunt remark.

I mean... it was pretty apt given I wasn't expecting a BAT in the store or for it to just sit there and get stepped on. Plus side is he's put me on shift in a couple of days saying I'll fit right in with my outgoing attitude and responses."

  Boss and i are doing the best we can. But some weeks are much busier than others.  So normal shipments either go super fast or super slow.  The past two weeks, it's been super fast. And while she has been overnighting product to the store, shipments are smaller and more concentrated on specific product. Until we get things situated.

  All valid points. But he wasnt letting me get a word in edgewise about how he could just get the higher dosage and break the dose down in half. 

  So he leaves.

  And then sits in his car. He found a coupon online and comes back in. Asks if ill honor it. I said sure. Like, if he had given me a chance the first time, i wouldve slapped on a military discount and called it a day. And the coupon he found was only slightly better than the military discount(by a dollar, i just checked).

So bear in mind, my work sells clothes too and we are not allowed to give the paper clothes bags to customers that aren’t buying clothes, because we ran out of them completely a couple of months ago for a couple of weeks and our managers had a meeting and were informed not to hand them out unless it’s for clothing.

Anyways one of the women asks me if there’s any boxes so they can carry their stuff. I tell her if there is they’ll be down at the end of checkouts. So she goes and walks down the whole way to check the ends of the checkouts for boxes and spots at the very end checkout the paper bags. She goes in behind the till and grabs a paper bag. And that’s when I go up to her.

Me: Sorry I’m afraid the paper bags are only for clothing.

Customer: (Looking shocked) So we can’t take this paper bag for our stuff?

Me: You weren’t buying any clothing so... no.

Customer: (Looking even more annoyed)
Are you serious?

Me: Yep.

Customer: (Giving me the paper bag back and answering back really viciously) It’s a paper bag GET OVER IT! 

Customer storms off and eventually finds a box for her stuff. My manager saw this all happening and gave me a thumbs up and I was there with my blood boiling.

TLDR; Customer snaps at me for not letting her have a paper clothing bag for her purchases when she wasn’t buying any clothes and we’re not allowed to give them out"

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cvhha5/lady_implies_she_will_pee_on_the_floor_if_i_dont/,"Lady implies she will pee on the floor if I don’t let her use the employee restroom. Okay, some background:

I work in a pop-up shop. We buy out unused space for our seasonal store. Our current location used to have a customer bathroom. It’s been empty for about a year. The plumbing is bad, and the entire men’s bathroom is unusable. The women’s has a single stall that’s usable, and one functioning sink. In one phrase: not for customers. 

Today, an associate brought a distraught woman to me. The lady asked for a manager. The following ensues. 

Me: “Hi, I’m the manager, what’s up?”

Lady: “This worker says you don’t have a bathroom.”

Me: “Unfortunately, we don’t. There is one nearby in [mall location].”

Lady: “Yeah, ya see, I know that. They’re cleaning it. They say it’s for *my convenience* but I need it now.”

(At this point I assume it’s over)

Me: “Yeah, I had something similar happen. Sorry about that; I guess it just has to be cleaned some days.”

(Here, she puts an empty water bottle on our counter and looks visibly irritated.) 

Lady: “Look, I just finished this whole thing, and I need a bathroom now. I know [old store] had one.”

Me: “I’m sorry, company policy says I can’t let you into the back. It’s not customer accessible.”

Lady: “So if you won’t let me, what would happen if I walked through there and you didn’t tell me to do it?”

Me: “Umm, I think you would personally get in trouble. We aren’t allowed to let anyone in the back.”

Lady: “Well, if I don’t get to use your bathroom, you’re gonna have a mess to clean up.”

Me: “I’m sorry, there’s really nothing I can do.” 

From here my coworker (another manager) comes up. The woman goes through the whole ordeal again, saying we would have to clean her mess, and we called the nearby mall’s security to see if they would open the bathroom. Of course, they said no. Someone was cleaning the whole thing, and they needed it closed. This was about 30 mins before that mall closed today (Sunday is early), so I figured it would end up like this. 

At the end of it all, my coworker went against policy and escorted her to the restroom. I was a little upset he did it, because others could use her as a precedent (“you let HER, now ME”). I just can’t understand why she wouldn’t leave and use the bathroom anywhere else. We aren’t in the middle of nowhere. 

Also, who threatens to pee themself to prove a point?"

Woman came in with a load of PS3 games, all in pretty poor condition (scratched and generally not very clean). I was working my way through them and I came to a copy of GTA5 that was really gross. It was covered in who knows what, all gunky and crusty. I got a cloth to clean the disc to no avail. Told her I couldn't trade that game in because it was too dirty and handed it back to her.

She took the disc, spat on her finger and rubbed some of the gunk off and tried to hand it back to me. She then got mad at me when I refused to trade it in because I didn't want to touch her phlegm covered disc! Man, I love retail."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cvdpck/oh_that_was_insert_amount_here/,"“Oh that was -insert amount here-“ Now I’m not sure about you but at the store I work at you cannot just enter a value and add that to someone’s total. This usually only happens when people are buying some clothes, they’ll have an item that doesn’t have its tag on it so I cannot scan it up. (I’m aware of the UPC inside clothing but that doesn’t work to type that in where I am). Generally the items of clothing will all be from the clearance section so they’ll say “Oh that was $1.00 like the others” and it’s like, Ok while I do not doubt that, I still would need the tag in order to enter it into the computer so that it will basically say “this item has been sold, we now need to order 1 more of this specific item to fill the stock” I explain this to them and they generally understand and will either go or go send a family member to go and retrieve another of the item. This however was not the case. 
A lady came up to my register, not your typical Karen. And she had a whole bunch of clothes to purchase. And first off she wouldn’t put them on the belt so that “they wouldn’t get dirty” so she handed me an armfull of clothes for me to scan. 
I eventually get to the item without the tag. 

Me: “I’m sorry ma’am this item doesn’t seem to have its ta-“

Lady: “Sign said it was three dollars” 

Me: “I understand ma’am however, I would still need the tag in order to scan it, so that the computer can then -“ 

Lady: “I’m telling you it was only three dollars, so just add three dollars to my total.” 

Me: “I apologize ma’am but I cannot do that. It’s not an option on the register and it wouldn’t account for tax, if you would like I can hold your items here while you go and get another one that has a tag”

Lady: “Whatever, just put it to the side, I don’t want it”

I set the item to the side and finish ringing up her items, she pays, I hand her the receipt and tell her “have a good one” where she doesn’t say anything in response and just heads to Customer Service and reports me. 

Also it would turn out the shirt she wanted, was not $3 but $16."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cvcxci/read_the_room_lady/,"Read the room, lady. This morning, my boss called a staff meeting to go over store policy with us as a result of a negative facebook review. (We're almost positive that the reviewer was lying, as she said the staff didn't say a word to her even after she tried to engage in conversation. I manage this place, and I know for a fact that we all greet the customers to a certain extent. We don't just stare at them. We also have to ask followup questions like ""what size would you like?"" ""Do you want to add anything?"" ""Your total is X dollars and XX cents."") So while we're all sitting here, it's incredibly clear that we're closed. All of us are sitting listening to our boss, nobody is at the counter, lights are off, and we don't open for another hour. Our hours are listed directly to the left of the door.

This woman, who has never been to the store, comes up and places her order. We're all staring at her. We end up having to prep everything on the fly, and she still doesn't take the hint that we aren't open yet. She complains about a long wait and it takes everything in me not to say ""it's because we don't open until 10. It's 9."" I couldn't have a negative interraction in front of my boss and the staff I manage/train, but I mean, the lights are off, a manager is giving instruction, and nobody else is there other than some people huddled to one side. There are also bagels and orange juice, as there usually is for staff meetings. We had two other people come in asking if we were open, and we said ""not yet."" She really couldn't get the hint that the lot was empty apart from my car, the owner's car, and the night manager's car. Nobody else in the shopping center was open yet, either, except for the bagel shop around the corner and the laundromat. Everyone else delays their sunday morning openings, too. She also said she doesn't come to this branch often, usually the one about 25 minutes away from ours. The hours in that store are identical to ours. I know customers are dumb, but I'd rather deal with them when we're actually open for business, and not when I'm exhausted and still pissed i had to give up my only off day which was preset 17 weeks in advance. I refuse to count today as an off day because I still went in for that meeting and I did do work, so this is day 8, and tomorrow is my last off day before going back to school. The wawa next door is open 24/7. Go there."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cve3kc/bullcrap/,"BULLCRAP So I work in the back of my store, stocking and stuff like that. But a few weeks back I was forced to learn how to work a register as side help because our company's corporate insists on making the entire store work with a skeleton crew, so the front end needs help often. Today I was called up front at about 2 pm. A guy who I think was probably my third customer came through and everything was mostly okay until the end. At the beginning he commented on the lack of baggers, I agreed that it was ridiculous. 

Everything was good, while I was scanning his stuff there was an Xbox card mixed in which seemed strange because this guy was probably in his 60s, but it's not unheard of and maybe he was getting it for a grandkid or something. I set the gift card on top of the counter thing next to the credit card reader and continued. Due to the lack of baggers the man was bagging and mostly had everything done when it came time to pay. 

He paid with a card, so I hit the credit card payment button and as it was processing, I said : ""oh by the way sir, your gift card is right here"" *taps counter* 

His receipt printed off and I started to hand it to him at this time as well.

Man: ""what gift card?""

Me: ""this one here. It was with your stuff sir""

Man: ""WHAT? THAT'S NOT MINE. You didn't charge me for that did you?"" 

Note: it was for $25, and his total was about $100 so it did bump up his total a decent portion but it's not like it was a $500 card.

Me: ""well it was with your things so yes I scanned it""

Man: ""WELL TAKE IT OFF""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir but it's too late, I can't take it off"" (the receipt is in his hand now so very obviously the transaction is over)

Man: ""BULLCRAP""

Me: ""sir I'm very sorry, but it's too late for me to do anything now, you have to go over to the customer service desk and they'll take it off for you. I'm sorry""

Man: ""UNBELIEVABLE""

Me: ""I'm sorry but it was with your stuff so it looked like yours""

Man: *walks off grumbling*

Me after he left: ""man, what a d*ck"". Not the most professional comment to make but I was fuming inside about how someone could possibly get so upset about something so pointless, so it's probably lucky that's all I said.

I honestly have no idea how the card got there if he didn't put it there but fact is, it was right in the middle of everything he had, on top of the rest of his stuff. There was no reason to believe it wasn't his. This man was also wearing a ""US ARMY"" hat so I had to mentally congratulate him on doing a fine job of representing our military. A true American hero, yelling at 24 year olds for things out of their control. That's the patriotic thing to do.

Everyone after him was fairly nice, a woman farther back asked what his problem was, so at least everyone else was understanding. I had some very patient people luckily the rest of the way so the rest of my cashiering went more smoothly."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cv48qy/i_yelled_back_at_a_customer/,"I yelled back at a customer  I'm an assistant manager at a dollar store. Our frozen food truck had come, and when they come they have to be received and processed immediately.  I'm still not fully trained, and the new store manager told me to handle it on my own despite never having processed a frozen food truck.  Luckily, the driver knew how to do everything and guided me through it, but it was time for one of the cashiers to go home.  She was supposed to leave at 1:30, but at this point it was already 1:50 and the store manager hadn't taken  her down, so I ran up to let her count her drawer down and go home.  

The other cashier was calling for a manager's assistance, but the sm wouldn't come up to help her.  Our store has a very strict policy that non-managers are not allowed in the office alone, and under no circumstances can money be left unattended.  I told her I would be as quick as I could, and the customer she was with said in a snarky voice that she would wait.  By the time we were done counting the money, the cashier's line was insanely long.    The customer she was with tells me I took too long and storms out.  Then the cashier tells me her register is starting to freeze up and was taking too long to print receipts. The frozen food was still out so I was trying to run back to let the other manager know that I couldn't do it right then and that I needed to help the cashier.  

On my way to talk to the manager the woman at the back of the line says, ""YOU need to open another lane right now!""  

I said back to her, ""Yes ma'am I know, but I need to speak to someone really quick I'll be right back."" She rolled her eyes at me.  

After I let the manager know what was happening, I ran back up and told everyone to move to another register since I was moving her.  

 An older gentleman gave me a nasty look and immediately screamed, ""WHY!?""  

""Sir, her register isn't working properly anymore and it's being slow.""  

""WELL THEN YOU NEED TO OPEN UP ANOTHER REGISTER!""  

I have never yelled at a customer before, but my stress levels were through the rough and he was unnecessarily aggressive towards me and wasn't the first person to tell at me that day.  So I yelled back, ""You're going to HAVE to wait because I need to move her to another register FIRST, and THEN I will open up another lane and check you out!""  

Everything was silent until I started moving her drawer after she finished checking out another customer.  Then the woman she had just checked out looked at the cashier and said, ""Thank you so much for being so courteous and patient!"" Then she looks at me and says, ""And YOU need to learn to respect people!""  

I didn't even respond and just opened up another register.  I was trying not to get upset, buy I could tell I was bright red and couldn't really hide the anger in my face.  Luckily, the man didn't come to my lane and everyone who came to mine was extra polite and one even started telling me she can't believe people are so rude to customer service people.  It felt good to finally have someone not antagonize me.  It also felt really good to yell even though I probably shouldn't have.  

TLDR; stressed at work, couldn't help my cashier immediately, her register stops working and I need to move her, irate customer yells at me, I yell back.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cvbjck/rude_customer/,"Rude Customer So this is a fairly short story. It was my first day working in a local dollar store, even more so, it was my first job. I had little training and was given the task of running the cash register with only one hour of training on how it works. So I was stressed out. And just to add a little note, I don't smoke nor have I ever purchased cigarettes at this time. So this lady comes in asking for \*cigarette brand\* shorts. I've had several customers before her asking for cigarettes and they kindly point them out to me on what they want. I'm trying to figure out the kind of cigarette's she wants and kindly ask if she could point them out to me. She just stands there, giving me a ""you're an idiot"" look, and not answering. Thinking she didn't hear me but not wanting to ask again, I hold out the each \*cigarette brand\* type and ask her which one. She points out what she wanted, but not without a dramatic sigh and huffing, makes her purchase and leaves. Needless to say she was not my favorite customer and I later learned she was banned from the store for shop lifting."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cvb8nz/60_cent_return/,"60 cent return Sorry this is my first post on both here and Reddit so sorry if I do it wrong.

So I've worked in a local dollar store for 3 years as a cashier that never got a raise (unless you count the time when the state raised minimum wage) and often on weekends because I was in college.  Sure enough summer comes around and I start working weekday mornings. It was a small town and often times older folk would come streaming in the morning. This particular morning my boss had a conference call, the truck had arrived the day before (which the stock room needed to be emptied ASAP), and we just received new labels for the shelf that needed be up ASAP. So as I'm frantically running around the store setting things up and working the cash register. So early in the morning, this older guy comes in and buys a drying dish rack, some candies, and the occasional miscellaneous items. No big deal.  As the busy day goes by and I'm nearing the end of my shift, the same older man comes in with his just recently purchased dish drying rack. Seeing him ahead of time, I know he's making a return. 

""Can I help you,"" I ask as he places the dish drying rack on the counter in front of me.

""Yes, I just checked my receipt and you over charged me for this,"" he says (not his exact words but something similar).

""Is it broken,"" I ask. This is the first time I experienced someone wanting a cash back for being overcharged.

He politely says no and just wants his money back that he was overcharged. Now at this point, I was the employee that had been working at this store the longest, knew my way around on how the store worked, and my manager trusted me. Not wanting to disturb my manager, for she was sitting in this claustrophobic room, and  conference calls are the worst, I try to solve the problem. After seeing the product in the computer, which said the product was $3.60, and checking the label on the shelf, which said the product was $3.00, I would honor the price on the shelf. (I still hadn't put out the new labels so maybe it was there). To no avail, I couldn't figure out how to give this guy his 60 cents back without making my drawer look like it was short on money or that the store has had a product stolen. Hating to disturb my manager, but needing to anyway, I explain to her the problem while she's half listening to the conference call. It must have been a stressful conference or the 60 cents return kinda sounded ridiculous as it did to me because she just reaches into her pocket and gives me 60 cents to give the older man. I give the man his 60 cents and he leaves as one happy customer. I never did find the new label for the dish drying rack and had to make a label with the actual price and item number."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cv3xtu/lady_tries_to_get_lower_price_on_runner_by_lying/,"Lady tries to get lower price on runner by lying This actually happened last week but I am now just getting around to writing it. 

In the wonderful state of Michigan there are several anti-false advertising laws in place. Part of the law is that if the tag says $2.50 we have to sell it for $2.50 even if it meant $890 otherwise the customer can sue. The law however can be worked around because customers move things around constantly as all retail folk know all too well. So if it's one thing in the wrong spot that is in the guest not on us.

At my store we sell cut to length floor runners, those runners have two ways of knowing the price; a 7""X11"" sign that's attached to the strap that holds the sign and says the price, and a vintage to the left of the roll itself. 

A lady asked for my help so I went over to her, she immediately inquired to the price of a particular runner; one that had a sign attached to it, but I never look for those cause most of the time they're not even there. So I tell her the price on the bin tag. ""4.49 a  linear foot.""

""But this sign says it's 2.39 a foot."" She retorts.

I look at the sign and sure enough it says 2.39.. but it also says the name to a different runner down and to the left of the runner she wants. The sign was for a hard plastic runner that's used on hardwood floors so you do t cray how it as you walk across it, the runner she wanted looked like a commercial welcome may with a halfway Greek looking etched border.

""Well that sign is for this runner."" I pulled the sign off and put it on the right roll. ""It's for a hard surface runner as it says on the sign, the right price is 4.49, as it says on the bin tag here.""

""Well the sign says 2.39 so you *have* to give it to me for this price."" 

""Well since I'm here and have now told you that the price is 4.49, and shown you the bin tag no we don't.""

""But the sign said 2.39."" 

""And I said 4.49""

After a second of deliberation on her end she takes a 6 foot piece of runner and leaves. After my I told her firmly that it was 4.49 she thought about fighting more but decided not to.

After I handed her off the rolled up remnant and she was on her way I went to take care of the runner and lo and behold I find the right sign thrown onto the floor nearish where the roll was. 

My bet is she took the sign off, found a price she thought looked better and replaced it with that sign. 

I cut nearly 15 runners that day, not a one was that Greekish runner until that lady, and there wasn't any signs on the floor until after helping that lady.

Sometimes you just have to push back against pushy guests because they sometimes know they're in the wrong.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cv022n/youre_stupid_and_you_dont_know_math/,"""You're stupid and you don't know math"" So this actually happened yesterday and I'm still angry when I think back to it.

I've posted here before another story I think about how I work at a discount store chain in Germany that is initially from the US but now exists in Europe as well. I'm usually at the register most of the time, but that can vary from day to day.

Yesterday I was actually meant to be working on the floor area of the store (where clothes are hanging, etc) and I was to be at the third register if needed. Well at one point the line was getting long so I jumped in to help.

There comes the rude customer. He bought something, I don't even remember what anymore, worth 11. 97 euros. He handed me 15 euros and I proceed to give back the 3. 03 euros back. At this point he gave me 1.40 euros more and demanded I give him 5 euros back. That's all good, I don't mind doing that for people, many don't like having change in their wallet so I usually do it. However 3. 03 plus 1. 40 doesnt equal 5 euros. It equals 4. 43. I tell him that the 40 cents don't really help but I can give him back two 2 euro coins if he liked and make the four 10 cent coins in two 20 cent coins so he'd carry less change. Oh boy if only I knew.

He immediately started demanding his 5 euros and every time I tried to explain why I couldn't give it to him, that he hasn't given me enough change, he'd call me an idiot, how I don't pay attention, how I cannot count, how I don't know math, etc. He actually told me I'm an idiot that can't count. 

I tried again to explain why I couldn't and he said fuck it so I gave him the change back, and before he left he told me that he couldn't understand anything I said and that I should speak clearly next time. All the time super agitated and rude.

I looked at him like wtf? I'm a foreigner, I come from Greece and I live in Germany so I do have an accent, but my German is better than most foreigner's because I started learning it in Greece so I could come here and study. I actually write academically in German and I've never ever had an issue with anyone understanding me when I speak. Everyone does, I've never heard otherwise from people. And through the course of the argument, he never acted as if he wasn't understanding me. He was arguing back so of course he understood every single word I said. He just chose to throw a last minute insult before he fucked off.

For background I’m a Sabaton fan. My work one day decided to do a non-uniform day, with the rule being that you had to be creative, Now I own an armoured vest much like the one Sabaton’s lead singer wears on stage, so I decided to wear that and the camo pants that go with it, and my black military boots. (Google a picture of the band if you want to see what I mean) 

So off I went to work. Working in the vest was a bit of a pain as the plates on the front meant bending was made harder. But I was luckily assigned to doing some tidying. 

Then a code 100 got shouted. Basically this means that whoever’s at the front of store (duty managers or cashier) think there is a physical danger. This includes shoplifters. If you hear this, you drop everything including helping customers and go to assist. 

I heard the shout and being at the back of the big building, I ran to help. As I ran up the last section I spotted one of our notorious regular shoplifters (she apparently steals to order) shouting at the duty manager. Apparently she’d been acting suspiciously and when our duty manager tailed her she’d turned nasty, which is when the code got called. 

The moment she saw me belting along in all my gear, she screamed so loudly and went tearing out of the door at speed. I must have scared the living daylights out of her, enough that she dropped her bag. Funnily enough we found a cushion in it which she’d definitely not paid for. 

Weirdly I didn’t see her for weeks after (she would usually come in a couple of times a week, and we weren’t a store I’d say you’d shop in regularly as a habit)."

I mainly worked at the food court which is where this story takes place. I recently went through health and safety training at my job, now that I'm no longer a contractor, when remembered this story. TL/DR at bottom, on mobile sorry for formatting and grammar.

Now I used with this girl named Beth (not real name). She was very nice and funny person to be around. She was part of our group that used to go out to eat after a weekend shifts. At some point she tells a story of having a seizure at a friend's birthday party. She told the story so calm it was a little off putting. She said she hadn't had a seizure in years after taking some medication and avoiding really salty food. I don't remember the name of the disease she said it was. The conversation changes and go back to eating. Still had a nice time

Some time passes and it's the middle of lunch rush. We run out of food trays at the counter so I go into the back kitchen to get more when I see her on the ground. Now I've never seen a person in real life seize up to this person but it definitely wasn't as dramatic as the TV made looks. It still freaked me out and no idea what to do. I run over to my supervisor's office and tell her was going on. She immediately jumps into action and radios EMS while clearing the area around Beth so she doesn't hurt herself. Some of the other workers starts gathering around. All out of concerned and freaked out, these are 16 and 17 year olds. EMS eventually gets there and supervisor rides off with her. 

The whole things freaked me out and she turned out to be ok. It turns out she ran out of her medication and was waiting for the weekend to get paid so she can get prescription refilled. We did find out a little later that she found out at the hospital she was pregnant again. 

TL DR: I walk in on a woman I used to work with, who hasn't had a seizure is years, has one at work supervisor saves the day."

I get the catalogue to check for the code number to order it, when she spots a fancy chrome towel rail on the page and tells me she wants that.

A couple of days later she comes back in and cancels the radiator as she was looking through some trade books and found a chain DIY store that has them cheaper, and though she wasn't rude she managed to convey the you people are taking advantage of me vibe.

So Friday comes, out goes her delivery of plumbing supplies and ... Then comes the phone call.

Lady. Where is the radiator?

Me. What radiator? 

Lady. The chrome towel rail, I ordered it last week, I need it for tomorrow .

Me. You came in and cancelled the order, you said you were getting it elsewhere.

Me. We cancelled the order with our suppliers, we don't have it, I can reorder it and get it to you next Wednesday.

It will strip enamel/grease/carbon. It's usually sold in 1 gallon sizes, looks like a can of paint. It's also sold in 5 gallon containers, but nobody ever gets that. This guy wants a 5 gallon.

I look it up and it says we have one in stock? I've never seen it that I can think of? I head to the back and start searching.

The back of the store has the wholesale counter, and that's where I found it. Literally buried in bags of oil absorbent, with a lot of dust. I got everything out from in front and on top of it, and luckily they have a metal ring on the top to grab it by.

I grab the can and slide it towards me and then hoist it up.

The can tore apart like wet toilet paper. This stuff gushed everywhere, luckily it just got my shoes. I'm holding the top of the container in my hand staring at the massively spreading mess. Guys at the wholesale desk are freaking out, then the floor starts smoking. The fumes were extremely choking. We all rushed to open all the doors and rushed everyone out of the store.

Called 911 because those fumes were extremely harsh, they sent in hazardous materials crew. From the time of the spill of their arrival was maybe 30 minutes? Took about 3.5 hours before we were cleared to enter the store.

Lots of ruined products around the spill, but the floor was the worst. It ATE the floor. There was a distinct crater where the tile was gone.

One of the HazMat guys showed me the can, which was over 3 years past it's expiration date. Turns out the expiration date is for the can, not the chemicals."

I don't have many issues with mean/rude customers either. Most of the issues I've had have been from other co-workers. 

Anyways, this happened a few months ago and the store was pretty dead. I was working with this older woman (we'll call her OW) who was at the register behind me.

It being slow I didn't feel like standing at the register doing nothing so I was going around picking stuff up, putting it away, and just generally cleaning up the front area. OW stood at her register and watched me do all this while I occasionally came back to ring out customers who came up front. Until a woman walked up that OW seemed to know. 

I didn't think anything of it and got back on register to ring out two people who'd come to my line. OW was continuing to talk her friend, and I spotted a second woman in line we'll call Lady. Lady stood by waiting politely for OW to finish her conversation. I'm still at my register, expecting OW to ring her friend out and then start helping Lady. 

Guess what doesn't happen? OW just leaves her friend's stuff on the belt, looks at Lady, glances at her stuff placed on the belt, and then turns to keep talking to her friend. This has gone on for about five minutes now and I can see Lady is getting visibly frustrated. I step up and very quietly say to Lady while grabbing her stuff, 

""Ma'am, why don't I ring out on my register? I'm so sorry."" 

Lady: -look of annoyance and utter relief- ""Thank you."" 

I start ringing her out and Lady and I end up having our own whispered conversation.  

Lady: -quietly- Who is that woman she's talking too?

Me: I don't know, I've never seen her before. I guess they haven't seen each other in a while?

Lady: -slightly irritated at OW now- She could've just rang me out. 

Me: -as I'm bagging her stuff- Yeah, and you don't have a lot either. I'm sorry, I should've gotten you sooner.

Lady: -to me- It's not your fault, I thought you were closed. -offers me a bright smile-

Me: -smiles back- 

I wish her a good day and Lady walks out. OW keeps talking to her friend for another ten minutes, rings her out, and tells her to have a good day. She finally turns her attention to me and comes around the register with a sweetly sick smile on her face. 

OW: Honey, you didn't need to do that.

Me: Do what?

OW: Ring that lady up, I was going to get her. 

Me: -decides to take the diplomatic approach- I didn't want to interrupt your conversation so I just rang her up. 

OW: Honey, I haven't seen her in AGES. I was going to ring her up. 

Me: Well, you were taking to long. 

OW: -slightly irritated- Well Honey, I'm older, I'm not as fast as you  younger people. 

Me: -because I'm a smartass- So? 

OW: -seeing she can't cow me goes back to her register and silently glares at me-

Rest of the shift was okay for the most part, though at one point instead of going to the manager about how she was feeling tired from ""standing up for so long"" to ask for a chair OW got customers to do it for her. Our manager was literally in the aisle right of front of us and all OW would have had to do was either raise her voice a bit to get our manager's attention. OW also got customers to lecture/yell at our manager who was super confused about ""making a woman who was in pain to keep working"". Manager then told OW if she was in pain she could've just said something and she'd either let her head home for the day or let her sit down for a bit. 

After OW left (early might I add) manager asked me about the incident with OM's friend and the Lady. I told her what happened. 

Never saw OW show up for another shift again."

They didn't like the selection of some random food, I think it was rice. Well they were getting really mad at me because I was the one there in front of them. It comes to the point where they threw a pickle at me (we sell those bagged pickles up by the registers) and hit me in the cheek. I was so pissed but my manager saw it and came out to help. My manager was actually backing me up for once and is very upset with the customer. Manager asks me to go call the police since we have them on camera doing it. But before I step out to call, an off duty cop comes in and sees the customer with my manager. The off duty officer asks me if everything is okay I told her no the customer (my manager was at this point screaming at) had assaulted me and we had it on camera. She told me not to worry and she called one of her co-workers and he was there lickity split. Since I was the one attacked they asked if i wanted to press charges, told him hell yeah I do. Actually ended up going to court for it too (the case didn't go too far because it was cut and dry that they did it). So they went to jail over a pickle."

My mother dealt with all types, and she was a pretty tough. She kept a nickel-plated Colt .32 revolver in a drawer behind the counter, for just the type of guy I’m about to tell you about.

I was probably seven or so, which would make the year 1974, I guess. This old guy comes in, probably 60 or so, grizzled, greasy, toothless, chawin’ on terbackky. Anyway, he mumbles something to my mom, walks up and down the aisles a few times, comes back to the counter.

“I want some weaver cookies,” he mumbled.


“I’m sorry, sir,” mom said. “Would you repeat that, please!”


“Weaver cookies!” louder this time.


“Sir, I don’t know what you mean,” mom replied.


“I know you got ‘em, gimme some damn Weaver cookies!” louder and becoming agitated.


“Sir, I really don’t know what you mean,” mom said. “Why don’t you just show me?”


“Why the hell should I have to show you what a gawd damn Weaver cookie is?! Are you stupid or what?!”


By this time, my mother had her hand in the drawer where she kept the revolver.

“Sir, please lower your voice. I’m going to ask you to leave now.”


Guy glared menacingly at mom, then stalked back through the aisles again. My mom took the opportunity to slip the revolver into her pocket. Guy comes stalking back up to the counter and triumphantly slams a box of vanilla wafers on the counter. “SEE?! GAWD DAMN WEAVER COOKIES!”


In a moment that I will never forget, my mom took the revolver out of her pocket, pointed it at the guy’s face, and said, “Thank you for teaching me what Weaver cookies are, sir. Now, get the hell out of my store and never show your face here again.”

I thought the old bastard was going to piss himself. He raised his hands, and backed slowly over to the door, fumbled his way out. As far as I know, he never came back."

Background: I got a job at a local department store as the Frozen Department lead(I've only been lead for about 3 months) which for any one who doesn't means I have no idea where anything is in this store anymore(the store got a remodel so every thing got moved around). I also talk to so many people that I don't remember what the customers look like unless they are regulars, so knowing her on sight is impossible.

Lady: WHERE ARE THE JUICE BOXES!? I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN EVERY AISLE AND HAVEN'T FOUND THEM!

Lady: PLEASE DO! THIS IS RIDICULES I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IN THIS STORE!

Me:(walks back to the stockroom where my boss is working on hanging the inventory lists) Hey boss what aisle are the juice boxes in?
 
He tells me it's in aisle 9, so i head back out only to find that the lady i was trying to help had vanished. So i shrug and go back to work. This was apparently the exact WRONG thing to be. I found out that after i left to get the aisle for her, she had wondered up to customer service to complain that ""that Shaved haired bitch""(me, half my head is shaved) was rude to her and didn't help her out. She did all this as she swore and yelled about how ""she used to work in retail so she knows the rules and everyone is required to know where everyone is""

~side note: this got a little longer than I intended, because context is important~

I work at a store where you have to pay an annual membership fee to shop, but get bulk merchandise at wholesale prices. Yeah, that one. When you have a membership, you get a card with your name and picture on it that the cashier has to scan to start the purchase (we literally have to. The register is locked without a membership scan or a key from a supervisor). We also offer a credit card that is linked to your membership card, and can get a two-in-one card with both sets of information on it. Because the credit cards are linked to the membership, they also have your picture on them.

Technically, the membership cards are non-transferable. Only the person whose name and face is on the card can use them to shop. Most of the time, we'll overlook this, especially if the cardholder is there with the person trying to use it (some people make a big fuss and supervisors will almost always let it go ""just this once,"" so it's not worth the fight). This, however, does NOT apply to the credit card, because it's a CREDIT CARD.

Cue our exemplar:

A lady comes in and gives me a membership/credit card with a picture of a man who, age-wise, could be her husband. I scan the membership, but hold on to the credit card because people tend to snatch them up as soon as I put them down to check out the items, hoping I didn't get a good look. When she asks to put the items on the card, I ask if the man in the picture is here. 

""No, but that's my husband.""

""I'm sorry, but I can't charge someone else's card unless they're physically present.""

""You can see my ID, we have the same last name.""

(Cue the internal eyeroll, because you and your spouse are the only two people in North America with the last name Chang/Smith/Gonzales/Johnson)

""I'm sorry, but he has to be here for me to charge his card""

""I can call him, do you want to talk to him?""

(Eyeroll #2 because you can call literally anyone right now)

""No, I don't"" 

Then is the reason I chose this story. A tactic I had never encountered before.

""Please?""

Now, note, this is not desperate, she isn't begging me because otherwise her family won't eat dinner tonight. It almost sounded like the way a child asks for a toy her mom won't buy her.

""No, I can't charge someone else's card unless they're here.""

""Please?""

""Nope."" 

""Fine. I didn't want to have to do this.""

This is an encounter I had with a customer when I was working at a significantly large retail chain, founded in Arkansas. This was years ago, around the time that flat screen TVs were gaining popularity but tube TVs were still a thing, to tell you how long ago it was.
The TV thing is relevant.
So anyway, I used to work at a retail store, doing all sorts of stuff. Inventory, collecting carts, carry outs for customers etc.
One day I did a carry out of a 30ish inch tube TV for a customer. Loaded it up in the wagon, and brought it to the curb for them to pull up and I’d help them load it into the car. 
Now this was a big awkward box, and wouldn’t fit into the door of the sedan the customer pulled up in. It wouldn’t even fit in the trunk of the car. Or at least the trunk wouldn’t close. 
There was a way that it could fit in the car, without the issue of having to tie down the trunk lid. I offered to do something that we weren’t supposed to do without asking, but if the customer was ok with it, go right ahead.
I told him that I could remove the tv from the box, then it would fit into the back seat, then I’d collapse the box, fold it up and load that stuff if he wanted it, into the trunk.
He said we couldn’t do that.
When I asked why not, he replied that all the seats were taken in the car. And sure enough, his family, who I hadn’t noticed before, were all there 5 people in total, 5 seats...
As I contemplated how I’d angle it into the trunk and began to cut some twine to tie down the lid he asked the following. This is a direct quote by the way, I have unfortunately committed to memory.

“Why ya’ll sell TVs too big to fit in people’s cars?”

Well, my mind popped, and I don’t remember loading it into the trunk and tying it closed but I must have because he was soon gone, having shattered my hopes for humanity.

I am however willing to admit, maybe he was trying to joke around, but it didn’t feel like a joke...still that thought is the only thing that gives me hope sometimes. That he was just being “funny” especially since he’d already bred..."

I approach a woman and ask if I can help her.  She responds that I can indeed help her; I should fire myself and everyone else who works there.  I was at a point where I didn't even blink an eye.  I just apologized, offered again to help her find what she was looking for and had a decent conversation with her.

He walked over to the woman and began to talk to her and I could see that she was becoming more and more irate as she was asked simple questions and eventually she just stormed out of the store, severely unsatisfied with the fact that we did not know what paint she bought last week, based on the minimum information she provided to us.

I used to work at a books and knick knacks kind of place. Unfortunately my work closed a couple months ago and oh boy was that a huge disaster. Every random person came out of the woodwork to give us a hard time on “how dare you close!” as if it was us the workers who decided this and not cooperate. Anyways, with a closing sale everything that’s not nailed down is for sale, shelving units, bulletin boards, extension cords, literally anything and everything. If you didn’t see a price on an item, people usually would bring up whatever object it was and ask us. We had a liquidation company price common items and whatever they didn’t price, my store manager was in charge of pricing. 

*Back Story*

We were about 2/3 the way through the closing sale and had condensed a few products and sections down. Every couple hours we had to rearrange to make things better presentable but it was hectic to stay on top of it. One of the Knick knacks we sold were small rocks. You don’t just have rocks on a shelve so naturally they were kept in a bowl. I had just checked out a customer who bought a few of them but I hadn’t realized they were the last of them. 

 *Bowl Guy Act 1*

Bowl guy brought up this bowl that had held the rocks (which was now empty). There was a sign in it that said “Rocks $2.99!” My Coworker E realized he wanted to buy it and called my manager to the front so that he could price it. She took the rock sign out of the bowl and threw it away. After no response from my manager, I went to the back room to see if he had heard and realized he was occupied in the bathroom. I went back to Coworker E to say the manager was “a little busy at the moment but would be up momentarily”. 

Cue Bowl Guy freaking out. He demanded the bowl for $2.99 because otherwise it was false advertisement and we didn’t need the manager. We didn’t realize what he was talking about and he demanded Coworker E bring the sign out of the trash. She did and showed him it was “Rocks $2.99”. He was still pissed was now demanding for the manager. I told him again that the manager was busy. He started yelling about why couldn’t the manager take two seconds to come prove him right because he was a paying customer. I got pissed and told him the manager was in the bathroom but would be out very shortly now. Bowl Guy peaked and said “F*** you I’ll be back and I better get it for cheaper. Your manager is not going to be happy with you” With that explosion the guy stormed out. 

Not even 30 seconds later, my manager showed up. After telling him the ordeal, he said he probably would have just given the bowl to the guy (manager was so done with the sale and peoples attitudes that he just didn’t care anymore) but that now he wouldn’t sell the bowl to the guy at all. He asked if any of my coworkers wanted the bowl or the identical one that was still in use if we wanted them for free . Coworker E did so we stuck some sold signs on the bowl and identical bowl. (Btw from the moment Bowl Guy came up to the time he left was maybe 5 minutes, it’s not like the manager was purposely dragging his feet, just needed to go, give him a break)

*Bowl Guy Act 2*

Bowl Guy came back 2 days later. He walked around the entire store looking for the bowls, obviously blind to the identical bowl that was still in use with the sold sticker on it. He purposely went to different coworker, Coworker B, when he came to the check stand. He yelled at her “you sold my item! You were supposed to hold it for me and I can’t find it anywhere. I told you I was coming back for it today (he didn’t). Where is it! I better get it for free this time after all this nonsense!”

My original Coworker E from his first visit stepped forward and told him she didn’t know what happened to the bowl. Bowl Guy was once again pissed.  This time the manager was out of town leaving Assistant Manager in charge (who happened to be on break at the time), which actually meant Coworker E and I were in charge because we were both floor managers (which were were about to explain). 
He belittled us by saying “shouldn’t all 3 of you be in high school? Let me talk to an adult.”

Coworker E “We are adults, none of us are in high school” 

Bowl Guy “bet you wish you still were though, cuz you sure look like that’s where you belong”

Coworker B “I’ve been married to my husband for a couple years now and we have kids. If I were in high school I’d be years away from all that, I wouldn’t trade” (She’s late 20s and looks nothing like a high schooler)

Myself “yeah I just got my double bachelors degree and I’d hate to have to work towards that again” (Im mid 20s, I do look young and I hate it) 

Coworker E “I’m two years into my degree and I’m getting married next month, I’d hate to have to give up my fiancé for high school” ( she’s early 20s and looks it)

Very defeated Bowl Guy tried to make up for his mistake “oh well it’s a compliment you all look so young. Let me know if that bowl turns up” and he left. He never came back. 

Tl;dr: My work was closing and bowl guy wanted to buy a display bowl, which needed to be priced by Store Manager. Bowl guy wanted the price of what it was displaying and threw a fit when he couldn’t get it. He came back later, yelled, insulted my coworkers and myself, tried to save face when we told him off, then left."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cufey9/never_shop_while_intoxicated/,"Never Shop While Intoxicated I used to work for a popular kids store a few years ago. It’s one that you’d probably not wanna take your kids into as you might end up spending a lot on add ons to it.

One night I was working the floor by myself for the last hour of store operations. This guy (probably late 20’s), his daughter (the most adorable but slightly spoiled child I’ve ever seen), and the guy’s friend (who smelled of a certain plant) walk into the store. Per usual I explain how the store works, the daughter picked out a cute toy, and I left them to pick out the rest of their stuff. 

Maybe 20 mins later, Dad brings a basket full of add ons while his daughter places the original toy on the counter. I’m making small talk to both of them, asking the girl how old she was, if dad was treating her to the toy for her birthday, ect. I read off the total to him, $200+ for everything. Since he and his buddy both were... not fully there in the moment and I was getting side affects of the plant smell off them, dad laughs and looks at his daughter, 

“you pretty fuckin spoiled for a random day at the mall.” 

I laugh awkwardly and finish the transaction. Duaghter runs off happily with her $200+ toy and dad walks out like he’s a baller still. 

To this day I wonder if when he sobered up did he question where $200 went while his kid played with her toy and add ons."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/ctylph/you_are_here_to_serve_me/,"""You are here to serve me."" This happened back in the late 90s when I was a teen working my first retail job at a popular department store.

The store closes at 9pm, there a numerous signs and announcements are made.  

At 9pm, I vacuum my area and tidy up, then do a final walkthrough to make sure no customers are still in my area of the store.  Seeing no one at 9:15 PM, I close my register and hand the money into the office.  I notice I forgot my keys, so still clocked in I return to my register to get them.  Of course there is a customer waiting at the register. 

The customer wanted to see a pair of shoes.  I told her the store was closed and the register was shut down, but I would be happy to get the shoes for her and if she liked them I would hold them for her until the next day.

""No, you are here to serve me.""

I was caught off guard by this statement, but quickly responded with, ""only until 9pm, since it is after that, I am leaving.""  

I left the sales floor, told the manager, clocked out and left.

I have worked in retail for many years (not anymore though) and have never had a customer tell me that I was there to serve them before or after this.  That comment really upset me.  I did tell my manager this before leaving, so she was okay with it."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/ctukvy/now_thats_what_i_call_blatant_shoplifting/,"Now that's what I call blatant shoplifting Just a short one today that happened a few about ago but still makes me go ""Are you kidding me?""

I work at a discount retail store that unfortunately has to deal with a lot of shoplifting. It's a mostly found out after the fact type of thing, people stuffing things in purses or pockets. We have security devices on a lot of things but thieves will still figure out how to get them off one way or another and we end up finding broken hard tags in pockets of other clothing and such (which is a pain because it sets the door alarm off and we have to check the purchases of confused innocent customers).

We've even found blood stains on clothing from people hurting themselves trying to get tags off wtf..

But blatant out in the open shoplifting is rare and weird when it happens and it happened today on my shift.

I was cashiering and starting a large purchase for a lady when a man comes in from the 'Returns Only' line. I don't think much of it cause people never seem to pay attention to the sign that says where the line starts anyway and there was no one else aside for him and the lady there anyway. He sats down one of those great big laundry baskets full of clothing, along with a set of sheets and a comforter set and just leans against the end of my counter. He sat it down really close to the lady's stuff so I ask if they are together.

The guys just replied, jokingly. ""No, don't think she wants anything to do with this.""

I very distinctly hearing an accent I thought sounded cajun. Yeah, I thought he sounded like Gambit from X-men is exactly where my brain went.

Anyway, the lady's order is taking a bit and a few more people are now in line but not backed up very much though I do have to ask people to not line up in the return line and direct them to the regular line. Par for the course for my job.

Just as I have finished the first lady's order the door alarm goes off and I look up, expecting to see some customer has walked too close to the sensors again to the like...only the see the guy with the cute accent bolting out the door with his full basket of clothes, some of which have screaming alarm tags on them that are now going off.

""Sir?"" I call after him, followed a much much louder ""**SIR!**"" 

The second one I must have been channeling my mother's teacher voice because literally everyone in the store could hear me. But by that time the guy had jumped into a car parked right in front of the store and sped off. I composed myself, picked up my walkie and informed the manager what happened before going back to checking people out. Of course the other customers were as shocked as I was and many of them kindly stuck around to give addition details to the manager when she came up to get my account.

It turns out the guy had an at least one accomplice, his girlfriend/wife. It was actually her grabbing perfume (which are kept in individual locked keepers) off the front display and running out the door that set the alarm off in the first place. Those keepers are going to be a pain to open without the special key. In fact I hope all their pilfered goods get ruined trying to get the security tags off, idiots. Oh and because they had the getaway car right in front of the building, the security cameras probably got a good view of the license plate. Aside from that there is not much the store can do.

It was just so wild. Why did he even bother standing a line? Did they really plan this whole thing out or did the GF decided to yonk some goods and he then had to grab his stuff and run? I don't know.

All I know if it hurt my throat to yell that loud at an idiot"

I work for one of the big 3 mobile retailers in Canada. The new Samsung Note is launching tomorrow. As such, we have been taking pre-orders for people. They are currently locked away waiting for tomorrow.

One of the people who pre-ordered came in today. He got the dates mixed up, and thought that launch day was today. He was very excited to get his phone. I told him that the launch date was in fact tomorrow, not today, and that I could not legally release the phone. He cannot make it tomorrow, but could come next week. No problem, we will hold your pre-order until you can come get it. He says that sounds good and leaves.

I left to use the washroom, and when I came back, my manager was finishing up with him. He cancelled his pre-order because he couldn't make it tomorrow. And he wanted to either pre-order it again tomorrow (how?), or from another location, so he could pick it up next week. Bearing in mind that we will be holding his pre-ordered phone until he can pick it up. We won't be selling it.

My manager just did it, to make him happy. But both of us were confused as to why he wanted to pre-order again when we would have held the phone until he was able to pick it up, along with his GWP.

At least now we have a spare phone to sell for someone who didn't do a pre-order. It still boggles the mind though."

He bypassed staff and spoke to the owner of the store, who happened to be behind the counter today, and got special permission to buy two pairs so that his wife could choose the pair she liked, and he would return the other pair. 

We usually only offer exchange or store credit for returns, but we can make exceptions when needed. My boss wanted to help this guy with his romantic gesture, so he decided to give this guy seven days to bring the extra pair back to get a refund. 

The man was back within a couple of hours to return the more expensive pair of the two, except he had put the cheaper pair in the box. My boss caught the swap immediately and told the guy he needed the correct box to return the glasses (not accusing him at all, he wanted to assume it was a mistake).

Of course the guy huffed and puffed and couldn’t believe how we were putting him out by not refunding him. He demanded the refund and said he’d bring the correct box by soon. No dice. No box, no return. 

He stormed out and returned later in the day, still completely steaming and refusing to speak, just tossing the box on the counter. Then, when his refund was being processed, he tried to again get the return for the more expensive pair, even though his wife had kept those ones. 

After he left (hopefully forever), my boss told us, in mock frustration, “Never do anything for anyone!”"

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cthp8i/you_gave_bad_customer_servicefor_knowing_how_to/,"""You gave bad customer service""...for knowing how to do my job from memory? This just happened a few days ago, compared to other stories(even my own) it's not that bad, but it's still pretty frustrating since it shows the absurd standards people hold their expectations regarding customer service.

I work as a mobile representative selling prepay(think tracfone, total wireless, ect.) and postpay(contracts with most major carriers) in a big box store type location. I am not an employee of the store I work in, my employer has just been contracted out by the store to do these types of sales so unlike the people who work around me in the department I'm stationed at it is quite literally my job to know about phones. However most people assume I am part of the store proper despite the fact that my uniform is completely different to other employees and that my actual company's logo is displayed clearly on my identification card I wear at all times. This is not that important for this story in particular but it does show that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to what I do.

I had just started my shift when I had an older woman come up to my desk like she was in a rush. She starts saying how she's with X-carrier on a contract, but through an X-carrier branded store, not the big box. She noticed that we have a better deal on a popular last gen phone(it's truly a ludicrously low price for the quality of the phone) and that she wants to set up another line for it. Because she is not on an X-carrier contract with the big box store I work out of I cannot touch their account(and they cannot touch ours, they are completely different which is why we give better deals on phones) and to get the phone deal through us she would have to have her entire account transferred over to us before doing anything, and in order to do even that all of the phones she has on the account(upwards of 4) have to be completely paid off. I had actually just dealt with a similar case a few days prior and that was the same procedure we had to go through. At this she huffs and says that she was in the store 6 months ago(I have only been working there about 2 at this point) and that the person she talked to then said something different. Did not tell me *what* the person had said different, just that it was different.

From my coworker I know that 6 months ago the newly promoted ""boss"" of our location was so bad at her job that she would just lie to get sales, so I ask her if it was one of our employees or one of the store's. She says ours and gives a description that sounds similar to how my coworker depicted the old ""boss"". I tell her that either the employee she spoke with gave her the incorrect information or that in the 6 months since the last quote the policy had changed(which, while unlikely in this scenario, has actually happened in the past.) and that the only way to proceed would be in the way previously described.

The woman starts muttering quietly under her breath, says ""Ok,"" mutters more, then turns to leave. I tell her to have a good day, and she comes back and starts an almost gentile tirade about how she was ""disappointed in my customer service"" and that she was going to a different location of the store(not all of which have my company operating in them) because I told her different from what she expected. When I ask for an explanation she says, ""You didn't look anything up,(Pointing to my terminal where I make contract sales) you should have at least offered to look it up.""

Again, similar situation I had mere days ago. The only difference was that case only had one phone where as she had four.

So I guess knowing protocol by heart and informing customers of them is bad service....if you don't ""look them up""?

&#x200B;

Edit to clarify the protocol I was referring to since there's been a lot of questions:

If a customer comes in saying that they are on a contract with Provider X and that they want to make a change to their account(new phone line, upgrade, etc.) through my company, but their contract is not with my company's branch of Provider X(say it's through a retail branded store of Provider X or the like), then myself and everyone else at my company cannot touch that account at all; not even in a ""*you aren't with us so we will not do it*"" way, in a ""*if I look up your account through our systems it will deny me access to making any changes because I am not authorized to do so*"" way. The reason is because plans my company sets up for Provider X and the plans the offshoot retail locations of Provider X has are two completely different plans, which is why the prices are often different. Therefore, the only way that they can have my company do anything with their account is to change what type of plan it is(note,***the customer won't see any difference in the payments/bills on the phones they already have on their accounts***) and transfer it over to us so we can set up the new whatever. This is why to even do the transfer all phones on the account must be paid off so that there's only the service charge to worry about, not monthly phone payments that the other contract set up.

I'm not saying that it's good protocol, or that it's not frustrating, but that is the way we have to operate."

Me: again, I did not call her a liar. 

CR: (interrupting) we can't treat our customers that way. We have to make it right. If I send her back into your store, would you personally give her her money back?

Me: Thank you for holding, how can I help you?? 

CC: I got my way. Customer service is sending me a new item. She said that you were snotty to her as well. You should have just done what I wanted and returned the item. You should NEVER speak to a customer like that and call them names.

CC: (screaming) YES YOU DID! YOU CALLED ME NAMES AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET FIRED! I WORK IN RETAIL AND WOULD NEVER TREAT A CUSTOMER LIKE THAT. YOU SHOULD'VE JUST DONE WHAT I WANTED. I'M GONNA CONTACT YOUR REGIONAL MANAGER TOO! *hangs up*

English is not my native language, exuse me if there is strange sentences structures .

Last year, I worked for a while in a dairy shop, we would sell cheese, cream, butter... and we were also making our own ice creams.
It was in a small village, so most of the regular customers would have an ""account"" where we write their purchases and they would come later and clear it.

Maybe once a week, an old man would step in to get a piece of cheese or some butter. He was really nice and would always talk a bit with us.
He would also take an ice cream every time.
Most of the time, he would ask us to add what he came for on his account.
But he would always pay the ice cream cash! 

I did not ask him why, but the owner of the shop later told me that he love the ice cream but his wife does not want him to eat it. He was paying it immediately so she would not know that he had some because there was no traces of it in his account and she would not know. 

Here was my little story,  I hope you enjoyed it!"
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/ctpruv/an_acl_warrior/,"An ACL warrior For those not in Australia, ACL = Australian Consumer Law.

I was fortunate to not have to deal with this man however my friend a coordinator had to deal with him for over an hour on a busy Sunday.

So the customer walks in with a phone that, according to him, is faulty. Its about 16 months old and we offer 24 months warranty. He has his receipt and everything so we assumed he'd be a decent customer. We have to run faulty products through our system and it will give us a remedy to provide. Due to us retail staff not having qualifications to assess a phone, especially this late into the warranty period, we have to send it off for repair to the manufacturer. The repair process involves:

1. Assessment to determine fault and basic troubleshooting
2. If there is a fault, with phones they'll generally replace hardware first.
3. If all else fails, they will send a replacement back.

So my friend (let's call her Judy), runs it through the system and it says it needs to be sent off for repair. She lets the customer know and his face changes.

Judy - friend/coordinator

Bob- phone guy

Bob: no I want a refund

Judy: unfortunately it has to be sent off for repair. This is what our policy and system provides as the remedy. If it deemed faulty they will fix it or-

Bob: no that's against the law give me my refund.

Judy: it isn't we are by law offering a remedy

Bob: I understand you people don't know anything about ACL, but \*I\* do and it says you have to give me a refund

&#x200B;

When I heard that I got pissed for Judy. She also stood there a bit shocked as well. We go through training twice a year on consumer law, and we have an abundance of booklets that we can give to customers, as well as read for ourselves, that talk about the law and how our policies go. Trust me, if what we were doing was illegal, we would have been in trouble years ago because it has always been this way.

Good ol Judy despite this tries her best to help him as well as not giving him what he wants. Similar back and forths go for over an hour. He left at one point then came back, his mother (who looked like a total Karen) would bitch about Judy and the company in his ear, so no wonder why he's like this.

Store manager (SM): we still have to send it off for repair. Us staff are NOT qualified to assess something like a phone as well as handle things with personal data on it. You can say that it is faulty but we still need to give it to qualified people to assess it.

Bob: b-but \*some more back and forth I couldn't hear well

\*SM: You can send it off to \[phone brand\] yourself and if they give us authorisation to refund it/replace it, then we can do that. However you still need to send it off to them and it'll save you shipping if you do it through us.

Bob: \*more back and forth\*

He eventually agreed to send it off for repair and purchased a cheap smart phone as a temp replacement. He left and I haven't seen him again. I'm glad the manager stuck by my friend and didn't cave into the demands.

tldr: customer unhappy with reasonable remedy we have for faulty phone, proceeds to undermine friend's ACL knowledge, tries to argue for over an hour, still sends it off for repair in the end.

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/ctqnp8/go_ahead_and_be_annoying_but_itll_cost_you/,"Go ahead and be annoying, but it'll cost you Busy as hell, guy comes in with his little hatchback for his appointment for a hitch install with a bike rack.

I hate bike racks.

Look if you want to buy one then fine, go nuts, but put it together yourself. Dealing with vague directions and confusing diagrams for an hour is time I don't have. There are three people on the schedule after you and they're all going to be annoyed at me, not you, because I had to work with directions written by people who sucked too much to write for IKEA.

Anyway... I see him come in, so I go in the back to get the parts together. Usually it only takes a minute to grab the keys from the customer and toss them back to me but after a few minutes I still haven't heard from them so I go to the front.

Gary's dealing with him. Apparently the customer has questions. 

""How do I know this is going to work for my bike?""

""Well you were the one that picked this specific bike rack so I imagine it told you on screen it would work...""

""Yes, but what if it doesn't?""

""You picked a universal bike rack. It works with everything. Is it a normal bike?""

""Yes.""

""It's fine.""

""But what about the hitch? Is it compatible? ""

...

""And you'll install the bike rack for me?""

...

""And it's sturdy? I won't have to worry...""

The line behind him is getting longer and longer. I reach over the counter and take the keys while he peppers Gary with more inane questions.

The install goes okay. I only scrape off a bit of skin in my rush to get it done, the heat and humidity are merely chokingly tropical rather than outright sauna-like, and the directions, while belligerently oblique, are at least in English this time.

Despite my making good time I'm asked three times for updates on how it's going. 

""Like sh!t. That's how it's going.""

""Any idea how long it's going to be?""

Poor Eric. He's a sweet kid but has no idea how to deal with me when I'm under pressure. I try to take it easy on him. I fail.

""Exactly as long as I told you the last few times. Dude, come on, let me work!""

Work done I pull the thing out into the parking lot. I swing through the store to see the line is just as long as ever, but I can't help out; the next two installs are already waiting for me. 

And Gary's missing.

On my way out to get the next car I spot him. He's with the bike rack guy answering more questions. Gary is too polite to tell the guy to screw off. I pull up to them and yell out through the window:

""Gary, we have customers waiting inside.""

""I'm a customer too,"" calls out Bike Rack.

""If you have any more questions I left the manual for the rack on the passenger seat. Gary has to go inside now.""

Gary moves off. I wait just long enough for him to be out of sight before I pull away. Bike Rack was saying something at the time... No idea what.

A few hours later at the end of my shift I spot him again. He came back. And he's asking Gary more questions in the parking lot. I don't bail the kid out this time... He's got to learn on his own somehow. 

Oh you think that's it? Nah. He's back the next morning.

Apparently the bike rack is ""too big"". After all the grilling, all the fussing, all of that nonsense, he just discovered it's ""too big"". He wants to return it and have us take the hitch off.

Any other customer it would be no problem. 

But not this guy. Not this time. Not if I have anything to say about it. 

I take my manager aside and negotiate a little. She was going to just give him his money back and have me pull off the hitch, but I tell her what a pain in the a$$ he's been and how we just can't spare the time today to have me do an uninstall.

Turns out she spoke to him when he originally called for the booking. He wasted 20 minutes of her time for what should have been a 2 minute call.

She meets me half way.

We took the bike rack back, but told him he has to keep the hitch. ""Guess I'll have to eat the $230 then,"" he said mournfully. And then said it again. And again. Three separate times, hoping we'd take pity on him and find it in our little hearts to refund that too.

But alas gentlesir, it appears you've used up all the fks we had and nary a one remains."

I work in a fairly well know craft store. My store is the biggest one in my state so it attracts a lot of crafters (and a lot of May I speak to your managers).

So corporate has made an app and wants us to push our customers to get the app so they’ve taken any coupons off the website and have turned them into flyers to download the app (ie. Download the app for 20% off your total purchase). All employees know this  and would never tell us a customer that they could “find coupons on the website” because there just isn’t any there (this is important for later).


So a woman and her husband come up to my register with some fabric as I’m ringing her up she tells me she left her phone at home. She tells me an employee told her there are coupons on the website she can use. 

I tell her all the coupons are on the app for starters, I am not allowed to keep any extra up front secondly, and any coupons on the website wouldn’t work anyways as they’re just promos for the app. Lastly, I explained to her that without the physical coupon (printed or on her phone) I wouldn’t be able to give her the discount anyways. 

Her entire attitude shifts, she gets incredibly short with her answers to me, just pays and storms off grumbling about how they should have gone to a competitor store as if 1: that’s makes a difference to me and 2: she would have gotten different results at another store in this situation. 

TLDR: Women tells me she doesn’t have her phone but heard there’s coupons online she could use. I tell her that no there isn’t and I couldn’t give her the discount anyways without her showing me said coupon. She gets angry and leaves saying she should’ve gone to a competitor store as if she would’ve gotten different results."

And it started like this

Me: Hello how can I help you today?

Lady: Hi I was wondering if you could help me?

Me: Of course! What seems to be the problem?

*Lady pulls out a sandwich ziplock bag with a phone and opens it to show me the phone* ***split in half*** *hanging by the wires inside and places it on the counter*

Lady: Yes I need you to take the pictures off my phone and save them to my google drive so I can access them

I stared at the lady shocked and pick up the phone carefully to not hurt myself and look up at the lady in disbelief

Me: Um if you don't mind me asking.....what happened?

The lady looks away from me and huffs as if I insulted her and crosses her arms and glares to the side

Lady: I just dropped when I got out of my care that's all.

I wanted to ask *While driving?*! But it wasn't my business and didn't want to be rude so I set the phone back down and sighed as I smiled at her

Me: I'm sorry Ma'am but the phone seems to be incredibly damaged and I won't be able to get any information off this phone I apologize

Lady turns back towards me and glares as she huffs again and looks back down at the phone before looking back at me

Lady: I just told you that I dropped it I just want my pictures off the phone you need to help me.

Me: Ma'am, as I tried to explain the motherboard of the phone where this information could be, is incredibly damaged and won't be able to resurface.

Lady: If you won't help me then get someone who can!

I sighed and looked at her tiredly

Me: ...would you like me to call my boss?

Lady: Yes!

I picked up my phone and before I could call him I looked back at her

Me: He works at another store we have here and could take a while for him to get here is that all right?

Lady: Yes I can wait but get him here now!

I sighed and called him and talked to him that someone wanted their phone fixed and wanted him there he said he would be right down I ended the call and looked back at her a smile

Me: He said he would be right down so if you excuse me

I moved to the side and started to help an old man looking for a glitter case for his granddaughter which I gladly helped him with it was a good ten minutes later when my boss came down the way

Boss: *towards the Lady* Hi what can I help you with?

Lady: Yes I need help. I need to get the pictures off my phone. *gestures to the completely broken phone*

Boss looks at the phone then back at the lady before he looks at me with the most WTF face ever I shrugged and we both look at the lady

Boss:....sure

Lady looks like she won the ultimate prize and looks at me with this smug look before she hands my boss her broken phone and a number to contact her when its done she walks away and my boss picks up the phone and puts it back in the ziplock baggy and puts it behind the desk

Me: Sir?

Boss: There is no way I can do anything with how damaged that phone is. I'll call her in a week and make up some BS anyways I'll be at the other store okay?

I nod as he went back to the other store and went about my day thinking about this lady and how she wanted me and my boss to fix a completely broken phone he told me he did call her and say there was nothing he could do and she was not happy at all.

Edit: Wow this blew up and thanks to the people who told me I used the wrong term when talking about the inside of the phone thanks for the info!"

Regardless, he’s my favourite character to come into my store. If people enjoy the chronicles of Larry, I’ll post more. At this point, I have four parts.

I first met Larry my first week on the job in June of 2018. He came into the store crying because he had lost his cell phone on his way to the store earlier, and someone had taken it.

Larry: did someone turn in a phone here? I lost it on the way here and it’s gone and there are pictures of my fiancé on it.. she died of cancer and these pictures are all I have.

Me: no one turned anything in but give me your name and address and if it comes in I’ll get it back to you. You should make a Facebook post.. I’m sure someone found it.

Larry: I don’t have Facebook..

Me: alright I’ll make a post. If I find it I’ll get it back to you.

So I made the post thinking nothing of it. 

**_Here is where it gets wild._**

Larry: Bless you man. You know, people around here are awful they steal things. But that’s fine because this community is about to be hit by a tidal wave the likes of which Japan has never even seen before and this place will be a mud puddle and no one will survive. Want to know why? Because of this. 

*larry points to his veins in his arm, and then to his hat where he has written bible verses*

Larry: I was murdered when I was three years old in Quebec. Thrown into a river. I died a child. In 1970 I died a child. But I came out of it as a man and that is when I wrote these verses. And now the lord speaks to me and has told me that this community is damned. It’s coming soon. And everyone here will be gone and they will pay for stealing my phone, burning my car, and not allowing me my royalties for the April Wine songs I wrote.

And with that, Larry left. He took his ginger ale and loaf of bread, and walked away without another word. I didn’t see him again until I found his phone, which will be part 2 if there is interest in this series of strange events."

TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/csycgw/sympathy_cards/,"“SYMPATHY CARDS.” Seems like every day I have a new post for here.

I was placing my lotto order on the phone when a lady came in and just started shouting “SYMPATHY CARDS” without even looking at me. I told her middle aisle to the left, and continued my order.

Her: (shouting still) UMMMMM is this ALL you have?

Me: (sorry again hold on lotto guy) Yes that’s all we have, we don’t keep any stock for greeting cards out back.

Her: WELL HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

Me: Someone comes in monthly and restocks them. There’s no overstock for them.

I continued my lotto order and she starts yelling again.

Her: How much are they?

Me: (sorry again sir) They are $2.30

Her: That’s ridiculous.

I ignored that and just continued my lottery order.

Her: Do you have any $1 cards?

Me: (sir I’m gonna have to call you back I’m sorry) No, those are all the cards we have and they are all $2.30 as the sign above them states.

Her: well I’m not paying $2.30 for a sympathy card.

Me: Okay.



So now she’s just looking at me I guess thinking this is some kind of haggling tactic. She eventually just left muttering to herself. I called back and finished my lotto order, then I went out back to start working on a coke order and the door goes off. It’s her again.

Her: how much are the sympathy cards again?

Me: they’re $2.30.

Her: why?

Me: What?

Her: WHY?

Me: Ummmm I guess the head office decided this was the best price to maintain stock while still turning a profit.

Her: so you’re trying to profit off of people’s grievances? 



I had nothing. What am I supposed to say to that? We’re a store. We are trying to profit off of whatever brings someone into the place to buy things. Anyway, she bought the damn card and on her way out she said “you won’t have any more customers like me today” which drives me crazy. You’re acknowledging you’re a difficult person, and acting as if you’re proud of it. Get bent, lady."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/ct8m64/ruined_dreams_an_auto_parts_tale/,"Ruined dreams... An auto parts tale. So years ago working auto parts, I had a guy come to me who was a bit of an odd customer, at least for us. This is why.

This guy is coming into our large national chain known for having the cheapest parts, with thousands of dollars in gifts cards looking to build a high performance engine. \*record scratch\*

I try to inform him there are much better places he can find what he wants, better, probably cheaper (because I have to outside buy practically everything), but he says no. He has the gift cards for here, because he heard in a radio advertisement once long ago that our company deals with performance parts, so he's been saving up gift cards for *years* for this. Okay.

So this guy has a '71 Mustang. Already has the rest of the car done, this has been his project for years (and he got the rest of the parts elsewhere, wtf). Now he's building the engine, but he doesn't really know what he wants. He explains that it's going to be a daily driver, but he's going to take it to the track as well for road racing. Over the course of the next several months, we built his engine.

I managed to put him together a solid combination built to turn 4000-6500 with decent street manners. Cost him about 30% MORE than it would have elsewhere because of my limitations on where I can order from and pricing. But in the end, the engine machining is done, the engine is IN the car, and now we just need the intake manifold and carb. I order them up, picks them up two days later when they arrived and a few hours later, I get the angriest phone call of my life.

Customer: This F\*\*KING CARBURETOR IS BAD! THE ENGINE IS FLOODED! IT'S RUINED! I'M ON MY WAY NOW! \*click\*

Great, I know this guy doesn't like too far away, so I go outside to smoke first. About halfway through my cigarette, I can HEAR it coming. Multiple loud bangs. It gets close enough to see and it looks like an old locomotive. It's trailing a thick cloud of black smoke. By the time the thing hits the driveway over 30 feet away I can SMELL the fuel in the air. Too bad, it's a beautiful car, dark red paint with black stripes.

He pulls into the parking spot in front of the doors and shuts it down. It diesels on (keeps running with key off) for a solid ten seconds. Reeks of gasoline. He gets out looking really unhappy and pops the hood.

The parts are clearly all installed. This is not good.

Me: Man, I'm so sorry.

Customer: F\*\*k. I don't want to hear it right now, just get me the corporate number.

Me: Alright... Here you go.

I call for him on our phone and let him use it. I go back outside to finish my cigarette. As I walk back outside, I can't help but take a look under his hood. The car is really well put together, all the wire and hose routing is super clean. Then, I see it.

I double take, to make sure what I'm seeing is right, then I touch it and trace it with my finger just to be sure. Then, I went back inside to my customer.

Me: Uh.. Hey.. You need to come with me right now.

Customer: Can it wait, I'm on hold.

Me: No. Just leave it.

He puts the phone down and follows me out to the car, and I point to the fuel pump. Then I trace the fuel line, NOT to the carburetor fuel inlet fitting, but to the 3/8"" vacuum port on the side of the carburetor, made for brake booster vacuum. The high flow fuel pump is literally pumping as much as it can through an open 3/8 hole. The only reason it even ran was the gnarly ignition box and the big camshaft that kept it from hydraulic lock. Oil was also crazy full of fuel.

He sees what I see in a few seconds and just goes pale.

I hung up the phone to corporate and grabbed him some tools, had it plumbed correctly in a few minutes. When he started it up however, white smoke out the exhaust, and you could smell burning oil in the air. The finish on the engine was trashed, needed to be rebuilt.

He admitted to me he was celebrating finishing it at home and hadn't been completely sober when he put it together. He cried a little. Ouch. Drove off in his white cloud of oil smoke, and I never saw him again. Felt bad for him, he loved that car. First and only person I ever even sold those kinds of parts to in years of working there."

A few months after chip and pin for credit and debit cards came out, we got a memo saying that due to fraudsters changing their MO to targeting cheques (checks, for you Americans), we were no longer accepting personal cheques (still took business cheques, though). 

I printed up a few notices and put them prominently on display.

The next day, this very large and cheerful (almost aggressively so) middle-aged woman comes in to buy a cheap pay-as-you-moan phone. 

So far, so good; 2 minutes work for a small commission. 

We go over to the counter, between two tills - each with a notice at eye-height and less than arms reach from her, she reaches into her purse and pull out her cheque book.

Me: Oh, I'm sorry, we don't take personal cheques anymore.

She goes from 0 to Karen in 0.2 seconds

K: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ""YOU DON'T TAKE PERSONAL CHEQUES ANYMORE""!

I was a bit taken aback, her earlier cheerfulness had lead me to let my guard down. I took a second to think about how to respond.

""Which word don't you understand"" flashed across my mind, but I settled on simply repeating myself.

She picks up a freestanding notice about business cheques and starts waving it at me.

K: WHAT DOES THIS SAY THEN!

Now either she genuinely can't frikking read, or is just really unobservant. It was so tempting to say something snarky, or passive aggressive about either option, but I just didn't have the energy.

Me: That's about business cheques, not personal ones.

For less than an hour Seeing the armed robbery story yesterday reminded me of my first encounter with an armed robber. This happened many years ago at my first retail job.

16 year old me worked at the convenience store near my house on Sunday nights only since I wasn't old enough to sell beer and at the time Sunday sales of beer were forbidden.

I had been working there for about a month when I was robbed.

Slow Sunday about 10:00pm

First female customer comes in (no car but not unusual) and wanders the aisles. Second female customer arrives in a taxi, buys cigarettes and leaves. First female comes to the counter with a six-pack. I tell her it’s Sunday and I can’t sell her beer. She tries to get me to sell it to her and ring it up the next day offering me an extra $10. I tell her no and put the beer on the back counter. She then asks for a hot dog; I turn around to get the boat and bun when I hear the distinctive sound of a revolver being cocked. I turn around and am facing down the barrel of a chrome plated revolver. She demands the money from the register, I comply ($47) she immediately wants in the safe and of course I don’t have access to it. She makes me lie down behind the counter and she leaves.

While I’m on the phone with 911, the second female shows back up wanting to know if the first one was still there because she wanted to “kick her ass.” I ask if she’ll stay and tell the police who the robber is, she replies, “I’ll not only tell them her name I’ll take them to her house!”

Police show up and take the customer up on her offer; 40 minutes later a police officer shows up with the robber in the back of a cruiser and has me ID her.

Side note: when staring down a .357 barrel it appears large enough to walk down.

I quit working for the company when they filed an insurance claim for over $400 dollars on the robbery by including all of the month's shortages.

The robber was on probation for armed robbery and aggravated assault. She got 12 years for $47 that she didn't even get to spend."

Her: you don't have a lot of those books

Me: yeah unfortunately

and we start talking about this bookstore, she wasn't snappy or angry just curious  why we didn't have the specific books and since there were no other customers I just chatted along. I told her that since we barely have any competition, we really are not improving and don't get new books.

Her: you understand that, why don't your superiors

me: well they don't really care as long as they make profit

Her: well you should make them  listen

and I almost told her ,,well that's a very German of you to say that"" but  I was able to change the sentence last second. She was very nice and I did not want to upset her, regardless this was the funniest moment in a retail for me

P.S. no offence, I love Germany"

She oozes trashy. The total for the transaction, with the coupon, comes to $4.

&nbsp;

""I have $3 on this card!"" she says, ""The rest I'll pay in cash.""

&nbsp;

She swipes. A beep. Before selecting her payment type, she begins pulling out coins. She doesn't have enough.

&nbsp;

""I have to get more from my car :/""

&nbsp;

I cancel the transaction, start ringing up someone else. She runs back in and throws a coin on the counter, attempting to run out with her bag. I stop her. We need to start over. But now, she left the card in the car. She runs back out. I inspect the new coin.

&nbsp;

It's large, larger than a quarter. Either an old dollar or a fifty cent piece. ""One half dollar"" it reads. As I thought. But, something is strange still. I turn it over...

&nbsp;

**Confederate States of America**

&nbsp;

what.

&nbsp;

What?

&nbsp;

***WHAT??***

&nbsp;

She returns. I inform her I can't take her coinage.

&nbsp;

""Why?""

&nbsp;

""It's Confederate currency.""

&nbsp;

""What does that mean?""

&nbsp;

""It means it's *not legal tender.*""

&nbsp;

""Well it was the only thing I had in my car!""

&nbsp;

Exit, stage left.

&nbsp;

What makes this interaction stand out? Well, one of a few things:

· She did not know what the Confederacy was (I don't even know how this is possible, but for those of you who aren't aware, the Confederate States of America was the country formed during the American Civil War to fight the USA)

· She attempted to pay with currency for a country that hasn't existed for a hundred years

· Even if she had tried to use it a hundred years ago, she wouldn't have been able to, seeing as how we live in a Union state. So, it was never legal tender here. Ever.

· She either had a genuine Confederate coin, worth a ton of money (thousands for a ""restrike"", almost a million for a original printing), and attempted to use it as a fifty cent piece or

· She came into possession of a replica coin without knowing that it wasn't a real coin despite it being larger than most common coins in circulation and also having the name of a different country on it

&nbsp;

Look, I'll take Canadian coinage, even a Euro or a Peso in a pinch, but how about we stick to currency from currently existing countries, m'kay?

&nbsp;

Anyway that was the weirdest part of my day.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Note: Due to the condition of the coin it's highly unlikely it was legit. Either that or this lady is in possession of the best condition Confederate half dollar in existence and is one auction site visit away from being a multi-millionaire.

Edit: Via u/inflatablepoolshark


> The CSA only minted 4, not 4 million, but 4 half dollars in 1861. Of those, all 4 are accounted for and b) they never hit circulation. The other 1861 halves were a run of 500 made in 1879 also never circulated. Last one of those sold at auctuon? 960k.


So it wasn't legit. To everyone telling me I should have picked it up."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cst3qz/you_asked_for_100_back/,"You asked for $100 back. So, short story. I work as a cashier at a grocery store and had a guy come through my line. He had only a few items so I quickly scanned and put everything in bags as needed.
The transaction was going well, he was nice.
He then asked me about getting $100 back. I nodded and said that I had plenty in my till, which I did.

He does the $100 cash back and I grab 5 $20 bills, grab the receipt, give him a smile and tell him to have a nice day.
You’d think that’d be it.....but it wasn’t.
He looks over to me and why he got $100 back. I told him that’s what he asked for in cash back.

TBH, it went back and forth like that for a while, I purely think he confused himself or something. He ended up saying “never mind, it’s ok.” With a smile and walks off. Like, he asked for $100 back, so I gave him the $100. I even double counted, so it’s not like he stole anything.

The lady behind him when she came forward with a confused look, we both talked about it a little and agreed either A, he confused himself entirely or B, he was thinking he was PAYING $100 and getting what ever that would be minus what he was paying for, which would have been $70 something because he paid a bit over $20.

Either way, was a fairly confusing experience.
He was nice and didn’t make a fuss about it all, so thankfully he didn’t get on my hide about what ever we both confused each other about."

I worked in a discount store and a lot of makeup there would get broken into and swatched. We have a policy that we can't sell makeup that has already been swatched (touched by customers) for obvious reasons. I was ringing and a customer (C) comes to my register,

C: I wanted to get this makeup but it is swatched already, can I get a discount on this? 

(Keep in mind that this was the last makeup of it's kind. We didn't have any more of it in stock other than the one she brought up)

I wasn't aware of the policy yet so I called over to ask my manager (M) about it. My manager looked at the makeup and came over to talk to the customer.

M: I don't believe this item is swatched, but if it were swatched I wouldn't be able to sell this to you at all because we can't sell swatched makeup. 

C: It is swatched, if you look at it you can see a finger print. Is there anyway I can get a discount on it?

Me: I do think I see it too it looks like a finger print

M: It may have been just a bump on the make up or something, but if it is a swatch I wont be able to sell it to you at all. I will have to mark it out. 

C: No look closely thats not a bump you can see the line from the finger print

This sort of exchange went back and forth for a while so I'll skip to the end.

M: Okay I believe you that its swatched. I will have to mark it out of stock now. 

C: Wait I want it can't I still buy it? I don't need a discount I can buy it at the marked price.

M: Sorry but like I said I can't sell makeup that's swatched so I'm going to have to mark this out. 

The customer was disappointed. I couldn't believe it. How did she not see this coming? She was given so many chances to say ""okay its not swatched, I'll buy it at the regular price."" Her desperate attempt to get a discount on already discounted makeup ruined her chances at being able to buy it at all."
TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/cssju0/well_i_didnt_know_there_was_a_party_either/,"Well I didn't know there was a party either! I work in a flower shop that does deliveries. This happened a year ago. The customer's mom was turning 90-something and she lives in a retirement home. The customer called on a Thursday or Friday to place her order which would be delivered on Monday. No problem.

The retirement home is on the edge of town, not incredibly far but it is an outlying area. For a normal day, the delivery drivers have certain priorities: anything timed (like before 12pm), hospitals, businesses, and then residences. Usually they build a route based on what is closest and spread out from there, keeping priorities in mind. Deliveries can also take until 5-6pm on a busy day, and Monday happens to be our busiest day of the week.

Around 3-4pm on Monday, I get a call from the customer who wants to know where her delivery is. I check the driver's route and let her know that it is on our afternoon run, it's on the way and should be there in the next hour and a half.

The customer gets REALLY upset, asking why it wasn't delivered in the morning. Since I'm the one who took the order, I knew she didn't request a specific time for delivery, and I tell her that I'm sorry, but there wasn't a request for morning delivery on the order. She says that since she ordered days in advance, it should have been the first delivery that day. I politely explain that deliveries are not first-come, first-served and that our drivers build their delivery routes based on the above-mentioned priorities, plus outlying areas are usually not on our morning delivery route unless specified.

She tells me that there was a party at the retirement home for her mom at 2pm, there were family members there and since her flower arrangement hadn't been delivered, it looked like she didn't get her mom anything and she was embarrassed. I apologize and say I didn't know there was a party at 2 or we would have gotten it there sooner. She says *well I didn't know there was a party either.*

I did call the driver and ask them to re-route to make this one their next delivery. The arrangement got there, it was beautiful, but we ended up giving the customer a $25 credit which she used this year. When I pulled up her account and mentioned the credit, she said ""oh yea, I think that's because there was some trouble getting it to her last year.""

If you have specific expectations for something, please say so and don't assume we know what you want or can time-warp to know about parties you have no idea about.

TL;DR: customer expects us to read the future and deliver an arrangement in time for a party she didn't even know about."

You had a home security system and when it is triggered, we call you and ask if everything is ok and if we can't reach you we requested police/EMS/Fire dispatch. Depending on what services you subscribed to. 

The company I worked for suggested testing your system for all services you subscribed to on a monthly biases to make sure we were receiving alarm signals properly. And to call us to do the tests to make sure an emergency services wasn't sent to their home by mistake. 

My last week at this job I had a customer that called in to do a test with their system. Not an issue. I put a note in her account (all notes are presented to dispatchers when a signal comes in)to ignore the signals we get so no emergency services will be sent. 

Well, the only way to test a system is to  arm the security system and then trigger the alarm by opening a door, window, ect..

The conversation goes as follows - Me=Me, Customer=C

Me: So go ahead and put in your 4 digit code to arm the system. I am going to put a note in the account so the other dispatchers know we are testing.

C: I don't use my code to arm the system. 

Me: Okay well then just arm it how you normally arm it.

C: But I want to test it like me and my husband are asleep.

Me: Well then hold the stay button for 3 seconds. That will not arm the motion sensors so you can still walk around.

C: But I want the motion sensors on if we're asleep. 

Me: Okay then hold the away button for 3 seconds to activate the motion sensors. 

C: But we don't usually arm it with the motion sensors

Me: Just arm it how you normally would when going to sleep

C: But you told me to arm it this way. How am I supposed to arm it for a test?

Me: It doesn't matter how it's armed. We are testing to see if we get signals properly. You can arm your system however you're comfortable. 

C: Oh so it's the customers fault for not knowing how set the alarm. You're being very short with me.

Me: I'm just saying you can arm your system however you want. We aren't testing how it arms but how the signal comes in.

C: is there anyone who speaks my language that I can talk to? You obviously don't know what I'm talking about?

I didn't hear much about it after that."

This happened a little while ago. I was outside a bar waiting for my boyfriend to pick me up (driving my car) and I see this girl stumbling out of the bar heading towards the road. At the same time, I see my car pull up and head towards it but quickly stop as this girl opens the passenger door of my car and gets in. 

Now my poor boyfriend is so confused and is just staring at me through the windscreen being like wtf do I do, and he tells her that this is not her Uber and that he’s picking up his girlfriend. This chick is adamant however, saying this is DEFINITELY her Uber because you know, she ordered one and this HAD to be it. By this point, I’m standing at the passenger side door telling her that she’s in the wrong car, but she’s now refusing to get out and telling my boyfriend to take her home. 

People are starting to come out of the bar and are watching this scene unfold. I’m at my wits end because she’s making a scene and telling me to “go get your own Uber” and my boyfriend is yelling at her to get out. FINALLY her actual Uber rocks up, she gets the notification and awkwardly stumbles out of my car...no apology or anything and they drive away. 

To this day I still find this so bizarre and hilarious."

We pull up to the place and we all get out and start walking towards the entrance when some guy steps in front of me. He’s holding up his phone and smiling. He says to me, “Haha, we’re the next ride.”

I didn’t know what he was talking about so I said, “Ok? Have fun...” And went to walk past him with my friends. 

He turns and yells, “Uhh, we’re your next Uber ride!”

I then realize he thinks I’m his driver for some reason. The driver is literally still in the driver’s seat and I just walked out of the car while laughing and talking with my 3 other friends, who also just got out of the car. I have no idea why he thought I was his driver.

So, one day after work my buddy and I planned to go play some disc golf, and he asked me to pick him up on the way. Some helpful background info here: we are both college students at time and I was driving a silver minivan. Also, my friend (let's call him Brad) is a pretty big stoner and can be an idiot at times..

Anyway, I was on my way over to pick him up, and while stopped at a light a block or two away, texted him that I'm about to pull up. So Brad goes to stand by the street to wait for me. Light turns green, I go forward, and turn on his street. Right as I'm turning, I see an identical silver minivan driving down the street about 100 feet in front of me. I also see Brad by the street, watching this other minivan approach, slowly walking towards it. Immediately I know he is thinking it is me and, knowing Brad is stoned and impulsive, know something is gonna go down. 

Unfortunately for the other minivan driver, he wasn't driving very fast and also had his windows rolled down. So naturally Brad, not looking too closely, thinks its me messing with him by not slowing down and he proceeds to start sprinting at this car and JUMPS HEAD FIRST through the open passenger side window. 

I cannot believe what I just witnessed and stopped my car, doubling over in laughter as half of Brad is still sticking out of this car as it slams to a halt, and he finishes squirming his legs into the seat. He then, finally, looks up at the driver and goes ""oh, you're not OP"". 

The driver happened to be some poor high school kid, looking on in shock and terror at this crazy looking college kid reeking of weed jumped into window. Not sure if he said anything, as Brad opens the door, gets out, apologizes, and sees me sitting in my car laughing my ass off 50 feet behind him."

I was talking to my friend during lunch the other day and I remembered another IDontWorkHereLady incident when I was in Hong Kong (nearly two years ago). Not as ridiculous as the first one just hilarious (on my expense, at least).

When this incident happened we were in a clothing store in Ocean Center (maybe Uniqlo or H&M? I can’t exactly remember which).

I was in the process of returning the clothes my mom decided she wasn’t going to buy when this older lady grabbed my arm and started asking me a question—I won’t call her Karen because I didn’t stick around long enough to measure her level of entitlement (even if the arm grabbing WAS already pretty rude in and of itself). So I’ll just call her OL.

OL is talking and gesturing to the clothes in her hands. If I had to hazard a guess, she might’ve been asking for a new stock or something. My brain freezes and goes into a lowkey panic mode because (1) OL grabbing my arm really caught me off-guard, and (2) I do NOT speak a lick of Cantonese.

I recognized that she was speaking in Cantonese but I had no idea what she was saying.

You’d think the whole scenario would be easily remedied if I spoke in English or Filipino to inform her I don’t work there/I can’t understand her but

Well

My brain kind of... stalls?

(Note, this entire fumble happens in the span of three seconds tops.)

It decided it would respond in MANDARIN.

I know how to say “I don’t speak Cantonese” in Mandarin but I for whatever reason when my brain realized speaking to OL in Mandarin doesn’t make sense, it decided, Ok we don’t remember how to say that.

And for whatever reason my dumbass brain jumps over English and Filipino, languages I’m ACTUALLY fluent in, and skips right over to an entirely different language I can barely speak.

Out of freaking nowhere, I suddenly blurt out, half yelling and startling OL:

“NO HABLO CANTONÉS!”

And I just

Ran away, trying to blend into the crowd like I’m suddenly in an Assassin’s Creed game.

Now, I worked in retail all through high school and most of college so I know how the industry works. I headed to the shampoo aisle and started pulling all of the products to the front of the shelf (facing).

When she asked if my shift was over I told her ""I don't work here"". Her face was priceless. I left."

Around 20 years back I worked in hardware support for a corporation. Desktop and server support, physical network installs, heck I even did phone system punch downs. (This matters.)

I am on my way home when I decide to swing by my local electronics and media store for a DVD set that had just come out, it had a cool figuring with it. Unfortunately my favorite color is blue and I had on a blue blouse. I had on slacks with my tag and key card flipped into my front pocket and a wee wallet stuck in there.

Went in, grabbed my box set and I am heading towards check out when an older man asks if ""we"" have this network cable in longer lengths. His cart is just filled with different lengths of cable. His son and him were setting up a LAN. Told them I didn't work there and then added in that if they wanted to save some bucks they could make the cables themselves and went into a spiel about how to do it and what to get. He was super excited. Cool.

I feel a tap on my shoulder and I turn around to see some guy with a button up and a managers tag on. He was smiling and polite and asked me to come with him. Said he needed to ask me about something, so I went. Got to the area where the bathroom and the water fountains were and the smile dropped.

Apparently he had just started as the assistant manager two days before and had been waiting to talk to ""me."" The exact wording is lost to time, but apparently he thought I was someone named Amber who worked there and since I was late again, as well as advising a customer against a purchase, he was going to have to let me go. (Apparently he missed the don't work here part.) I explained I didn't work there and I was doing this he interrupted me to ask me why wasn't I wear my tag which he would need back, and he reached down and grabbed my tag which was attached to an elastic clip. He pulled, I dropped the DVD set (crack), and out came my tag, key card and wallet. 

So I cursed loudly because he is standing there holding a tag that CLEARLY does not say Amber and is bleeding all over it. He apparently cut himself when the clip snapped to him. At which point he says something about me scratching him with my nails, (of which I didn't have because of work plus I never touched the guy), and walks through the doors STILL HOLDING MY TAG AND KEYCARD. I scoop up my wallet and went after him. He snatched a phone off the wall and is calling the police. 

So I am yelling at this point. ""Dude give me my effing tag back!"" Idiot assistant manager. ""I was just assaulted!"" 

Of course I freak. 911 operator probably thought he was being assaulted by the way I was yelling. 

Finally I calm down and just stand there with my arms crossed refusing to move with him holding my tag over his head like I am 5 yrs old. Police show up and we both tell our stories. The older cop pulls him off to the side, then me. Finally both the cops, him, and I are all standing there. His story it seems is that I was trying to steal the DVDs and I had assaulted him when he tried to stop me. The older cop simply asked him, why are you holding her tag? The assistant manager looked down at his hand, still bloody and starts stammering that he took it so I couldn't leave. Manager has now shown up and I tell my story again. He looked like he had swallowed a bug. Cop asked about the employee Amber, sure enough, she was already on the floor. It seems the fact that I knew Amber had a habit of being a few minutes late convinced both the cops and the Manager.

I did press charges. If he had done that stupid crap and then had just apologized it would have been one thing. But he was clearly feeling big in the britches and when he made a mistake decided to lie.

I was delivering items to coworkers on the way. Lotion for this person, some hard to find hair dye for that person, and most of the people were the hard to find snacks.

As with every store, we have vendors that come and stock their product.  Most of them make an effort to not dress anything like our uniform, which is a grey polo and black pants.

Yesterday, I saw one of our vendors (wearing a bright royal blue t-shirt) looking around confused, and a wild Karen staring at him expectantly.  I asked her what she was looking for.  She said ""He's helping me.""

I said ""He doesn't work here, what is it you're looking for?""

Karen:  ""HE'S helping me!""

Me:  ""He DOESN'T WORK HERE.  What are you looking for?""

Karen:  ""Oh.  I'm looking for \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.""

Normally I'll take a customer to what they're looking for, but this time I just said ""Aisle 9C, top shelf.""

This happened last weekend, when I drove to my friend's apartment. As I'm pulling up to the front door of the building, a guy on his phone walked up to my car and tried to open the door to the passenger side. My door was locked, so he finally looked up from his phone and banged on my window. I was a bit startled, but I figured he was waiting for Uber so I shake my head to him. The guy then rolled his eyes and tried my car's backseat door. Of course it's also locked, and he was pulling at it with visible violence that I thought he would break the handle off. 

I quickly open the back window and told him ""Hey, I'm not your uber.""

He angry shouts back ""Quit wasting time and just open the door already!"". At the same time, he reached inside the car to try to unlock the door.

I was in a bit of a panic and closed the back window. He pulled his arm back out and swore. I opened the passenger window a bit and shouted at the top of my lungs ""I AM NOT YOUR UBER! CHECK YOUR PHONE FOR CAR DESCRIPTION!""

Just in time, another car with completely different color and make, with an Uber sticker on the windshield, pulled up behind me. The guy checks his phone again, looked at the car behind me, muttered to himself, and dashed to the other car.

Is it just me or the world is getting angrier and scarier?"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/djlpin/wholesome_idwhl_moment_at_the_craft_store/,"Wholesome IDWHL Moment at the Craft Store Hello all! This is my first post here, so please bear with me! English is my first language, I just suck, also, on mobile lol.

A bit if background.

I live in the Midwest of the USA, and I live in a small town, and I sometimes would go out shopping with my family sometimes (I'm in college now so, woo). I am a very tall girl, dark brown hair, and I can be very friendly when I want, so I can see how this would have happened.

Now to the story.

This happened about two years ago, so this is what I remember.



I was out with my grandma, really sweet lady, to the craft store, my mother and I's favorite one at that. The uniform for this place is a blue shirt and beige pants. Now, I was wearing a pair of blue jeans, cowgirl boots, had my hair up in a ponytail, and was wearing one of my favorite shirts; a blue Pokémon shirt that had the words""Pokémon Trainer"" written on it, along with the well known mascot and a yellow thunderbolt.

Now, I was in one isle, looking at some sketchbooks, and my grandma was in the other isle. I was minding my own, my back turned to the other end of the isle, when a little lady who, in no way looked like a Karen, walked up to me.

Cast: ESE: Me, NL: Nice Lady, G: My grandma


NL: *Walking up the isle, holding up her hand* Excuse me, but can you--

I saw her from the corner of my eye, and this was long before I started listening to Reddit things, so this was new to me, but I knew where this was going as I could tell what she was thinking.

ESE: *I fully turn towards her, fully showing off the bright yellow bolt on my chest* *Giving a small laugh* Sorry, ma'am,but I don't work here!

NL: *Her eyes widen but then she begins to laugh* Oh my! I'm so sorry!

ESE: *I laugh along, but then I see my grandma peeking around the corner at me*

G: *Wheezing because I'm just the funniest thing to her*

I roll my eyes at her as the NL thanks me anyways and goes to try and find what she was looking for. I wave and say goodbye, giving her at least a little help, as I knew the store kinda well, but I still told her that I could be wrong.

My grandma comes into the isle with me, almost crying from laughing. 

G: Oh, baby girl (my nickname), that was some funny shit.

That was a funny story to tell when I got home.

Not the most exciting thing, but sometimes we could all use a little wholesome in our lives. I'm one of the lucky ones in the sense that I live in a decent area, and I've never had a run in with the infamous Karen, in fact, most people around here are well mannered and polite.

Hope you all enjoyed my first post! Oh, and if it happens to get into YouTube, can someone please put it in the comments? It'll give me something to listen to while I do my studies!"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/djea61/i_do_work_here_leave_him_alone/,"I do work here, leave him alone. So in this case, I was the person who was working.
I worked at a bar that had live music and other events at least a couple times a week and our live music night was always during my opening shift. I was a bartender and manager and also a woman.
99% of the time the musicians and bands were amazing but this one douchebag drove me up the wall. He came in and started asking one of my customers at the bar (a male regular who was actively drinking) where to put his gear. The customer says “hey man I don’t work here. Ask her.” And points at me. 
I begin to explain to this guy where to put his gear and the best place to park the van, etc, when he cuts me off and continues asking questions to the regular. Won’t even make eye contact with me, and I’m actively standing behind a bar obviously working there. The customer is looking at me like obviously confused and keeps explaining that he doesn’t work there. Eventually I continue speaking louder and louder until I shouted “stop bothering him! He is not an employee. I am the one in charge.”
The dude just turns around and walks away, eventually comes back with the rest of the band who are quite normal and don’t have a problem communicating with a woman. 
It was very bizarre."

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/djd59h/i_am_not_a_guide_for_haunted_attractions/,"I am not a guide for Haunted Attractions Well, it seems I can't escape the I don't work here moments at Haunted attractions. Last night I went to a haunted attraction with a friend. If you read my previous haunted attraction one, then I have to say this, It was a different friend and different Attraction.  Also sorry this is long, for me this was a curious thing, which I didn't realize was a I don't work here lady moment for most of the night.

The night started with my friend and I going to this haunted attraction. We were wearing our skeleton outfits we got to look spooky together. You can wear costumes to these things. When we check in the lady at the window stopped and asked what I was doing  out of costume. After we chatted for a bit and her showing me a photo, turns out someone who looks just like me works there. I showed her my ID and she laughed at the strangeness of it all. My friend and I thought it was funny too.

We joked and chuckled as a rather large group seemed to be following us. We spoke to each other the oddness that there was a group of over 30 kids whom looked like young teens at most here without more adults. It was kinda odd. However They were pretty chilled so we didn't pay them much mind. Every once and a while one would run over to us and ask a question, but it was pretty chilled. Then hayride came and we got on board. My friend and I making jokes and such. It was fun. And everyone, but me, have so much fun at the clown moment. I am scared of clowns and the clowns used this to their advantage to  have me say the iconic horror line. ""He's behind me isn't he?"" and the clowns saying stuff like ""we know where you live."" all in good fun, and since we knew some people who worked at this attraction and were playing the clowns they pretty much pulled me around the hayride for kicks. Got to love having friends who are scaring professionals.

After the hayride, my friend and I chatted on which part to do next. ""Um, is it just me or are we surrounded?"" asked my friend as the group of kids appeared next to us with those couple of adults in tow.

""Yeah, escape to the haunted house?"" I asked

""Yep!"" she said and we ran off trying to get away from the group as neither of us do good with crowds. Funny thing, those kids were fast! They kept up! So we ended up at the haunted house with the group of kids and couple of adults in tow. And yep in our group was were put in had a few of the kids whom seemed very eager. And yes questions ensued.

My friend and I tried to ignore the kids. However that was much harder this time. As they would go the wrong way, try to hit the actors, or (not even sure how) get stuck on the set pieces.  As my friend and I knew some of the actors and how hard it is to put on the show, we were doing our best to keep these kids from making a mess of things.  It was like babysitting without getting paid, yet with awesome things around. Bright side was no one complained about the fact my friend and I were having fun trying to spook each other out too. I mean I did 'disappear' at one point of the haunted house as part of a magic act only to jump out from behind a tombstone at the graveyard. (best placement of an exit tunnel ever!)

After the haunted house My friend and I got some drinks because we were thirsty and pondered about the bathroom, the kids were still nearby and asking us for permission to do stuff like get drinks. To which we said ""why should we care, if you want to you can. You just have to buy it, so if you don't have money for it, ya can't get it.""

So we went to the haunted maze, again Kids from the group were following us. By the time it was our turn the whole group of kids were in the line with the couple of adults in tow. At this point i was questioning if those adults even knew how to speak. And true to form some of the kids were in our group.  This wouldn't have been much of a bother if it wasn't for the fact that when things suddenly turned black and completely dark I was clung to by a screaming girl, that would have been okayish if it wasn't for the fact that when she tackled me to cling to me she got my neck so she was choking me. So in the middle of the maze, in complete darkness I am struggling with a young teen girl whom is pretty much hugging my neck. It would have been funny if I was able to breath. One of the other kids got the girl off me and I panted for air. Besides that moment The maze wasn't bad, yet again stopping the kids from fighting with the actors.

After the maze my friend and I decided to eat some halloween foods like their fried oreos and the pumpkin ice cream. We were sitting as we noticed the kids were waiting for the other kids. We only noticed this.  The kids were getting their after events snack or whatever. I was tossing out our trash as the one boy yelled. ""I am going to the bathroom"" and he started to run in my direction which was towards the bathroom. Terrible design reared it's ugly head. I noticed between the trashcans and the bathrooms was the tractor path and the boy was heading straight for an oncoming tractor. The boy got to me and I scooped him up as the tractor got to  us. I put him down next to me. ""Are you insane? Didn't you see the tractor? You could have been run over! Thank god you are alright! Don't do that again, ya hear!"" I yelled.

The boy stared at me and then thanked me. After the tractor pass he went to the bathroom. That was when one of the adults came up to me. I was prepared to get chewed out by a parent for touching their kid or yelling at the kid. ""Thank you so much, You really do do a good job here. Do I give you the tip or do I give it to your boss?"" said the woman

""Excuse me?"" I asked confused.

""Tip. You are an excellent guide for our school trip. You even saved one of our students."" She said smiling at me.

That was when it dawned on me, The reason the kids kept following us around and asking us questions. ""Um, sorry I don't work here. I am not a guide."" I said to the woman

The woman looked at me rather surprised. ""What? But you showed the kids around, you answered their questions, The workers touched you!! They are not allowed to touch us!"" she said sounding very confused.

I laughed. ""Um, yeah, Ya see those were my friends. They work here. I don't. So yeah, my friends know I will play along and we would never hurt each other.  So yeah, not a guide, just a friendly person whom didn't want to see anyone get hurt. But if you are their teacher you should tell them not to pick fights with the people working here, that as an issue. No one wants to get hurt."" I said to her. she smiled and walked off to the group.  I rejoined my friend and told her what was going on. she got a laugh out of it. We were chilling out for a bit still drinking some hot cocoa, when the group of kids and the adults came up to us and all said thank you together before they left.

""Man, I wish my school did school trips like this."" said my friend.

""Me too, not sure if they really are a school, but with that many kids per an adult I sure hope."" I replied, before we left and went to enjoy watching  halloween movies for the rest of the night."

About a week ago I was in a grocery store near where I live in New Zealand, I was actually going for a job interview but I got there too early so i went to see if I could find something for a quick snack. I was wearing a blue low cut dress with a red singlet under it and a blue tiki shirt on top, the uniform at the store was mostly greens and tan for the top and black pants . . . nothing like what I had on tbh, plus they usually have name tags on.

Anyway, as I was walking through the isle this sweet old lady comes up to me and asks me if I work there and where the yogurt was, I of course being pretty shy went a bit pale as I told her I actually didn't work there. 

She apologized and went to walk away but I somehow got the courage to tell her where the yogurt was (I knew since all the cold stuff is in the same area, which was on the other side of the store from where we were). She thanked me and walked away with a smile.

Made me feel good to help where I could, still felt awkward and embarrassed though haha. I'm just glad she was nice and not rude like a lot of people in the stories here"

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/diupig/sticky_fingers_and_a_green_thumb/,"Sticky Fingers and a Green Thumb I work in a job that often requires a lot of miscellaneous furniture and decorative items. This means I find myself at IKEA quite regularly with a shopping list the length of my arm. At this point I know every short cut, where all the trolley and basket stacks are around the shop (there are not nearly enough) and I've got the layout down pretty well. It's far from my favourite place on earth, but it no longer terrifies me like it did the first time I found myself walking the 70 mile showroom. 

Now my story is a bit like a Russian Doll because I've actually had quite a few different encounters and each time I think I've popped the head off the beast, there is another smaller, more vaguely annoying encounter lurking inside, just waiting for the next time I find myself at the mercy of the Blue and Yellow Gods.

And you can say I'm being dramatic - and I am - but as with any good Russian Doll, the tiny woman at the centre is always the one to really watch out for.

Normally the extent of the encounters I have is someone asking me where something is in the store or asking me if I can check inventory for something (is that even a thing at IKEA). And honestly, if I can help direct them I do before politely telling them I don't actually work there. I get my apologies and my thank yous and then I wander off to get the next thing on my list. 

But then there was THE THIEF (TT).

On this occasion I was in the greenhouse picking up plants. I needed around 40 plants and pots ranging from succulents to mini trees and I had 5 trolleys circled around me by the time I was done. I hadn't really had a plan of the exact plants I needed when I went in as it's easier to figure out the logistics when I've got the stock in front of me (you also can't order anything from the greenhouse online). So I'm finally done, red faced and sweating from hauling plants around and I realise I now have to get me and my 5 trolleys to the check out. The way the shop is laid out, this just means getting out of the greenhouse and then dragging my cargo across the warehouse, but it's still a fair distance. 

I've got the exact stuff I need and I was paranoid that someone might try and take something so I did it in little increments, getting all the trolleys to check points along the way instead of taking one the whole way and then coming back for the next one. It turns out it was a smart move as part way through one of the check points I turned back to see a woman rooting through one of my trolleys. I quickly sprinted back to her:

**Me:** Oh, sorry those are actually my trolleys.

I took the handle of the one nearest to her and smiled. She frowned back at me.

**TT:** But you left them. 

**Me:** I wasn't abandoning them, I just have too many to move all at once. 

She didn't respond, she just turned and walked off to another shelf and after a moment of watching her go I got back to the job at hand. It was barely two minutes later when I caught her at it again. This time trying to take one of the plants out of the trolley. I ran back again, starting to get annoyed.

**Me:** Hey, excuse me. Please could you put that back. 

She looked a bit startled but was still frowning at me when she spoke. 

**TT:** Why?

**Me:** Because it was in my trolley, you can't just take it out.

**TT:** Well where are they in the shop then? I can't find them. 

She gestures with the plant still in her hand so I reach out to take it back from her. I sigh internally as I was pretty sure I'd got the last couple and had had to diversify my own purchase due to low stock, but wanting to be rid of her I pointed her towards the area I'd found them and tried to hurry up and get to the check out faster. But I was not fast enough.

I was almost there, almost to salvation when I found the woman back at my card, trying to pull out one of the plants again. I'd shifted them round a little to make it a bit harder so she hadn't quite freed it when I got there.

**Me:** Hey, I told you you can't do that. Put it back

**TT:** No, there aren't any left. I need this one.

**Me:** Well, I'm sorry there aren't any left but you can't just take one from my trolley because of that.

**TT:** This is ridiculous. Why the hell not? Do I honestly have to wait for you to stock the shelf before I can take them? That's insane when I could just take it now and save us both the trouble.

...And suddenly I realised what was happening. Again.

**Me:** Uh, miss. I don't work here. I'm a customer like you. This is stuff I want to buy.

I watched as her brain computed this revelation. She looked me up and down like she was assessing whether I could be trusted, before obviously deciding she needed to exit the situation. Spluttering something that *could* have been an apology she turned and left, walking back to the greenhouse.

I finished my relay race and checked out successfully, I didn't see TT again. In a way, I do get where she was coming from. Someone pushing around 5 trolleys of foliage probably does look a bit strange amongst the new couples picking out  bedside tables and the families browsing for desk chairs. But then again I wasn't in uniform, told her to leave the stuff alone multiple times and was pretty obviously heading *away* from the greenhouse where any stocking would have taken place, so she's also kind of an idiot.

I'm not looking forward to the next IKEA trip."

Today was one of those times. I was working and a sweet old lady asked me where to find something. I started to give her directions but she looked blank so I just walked her over there, discussing her new easy chair with her as we walked. 

She found what she was looking for. An annoying woman and her teenage daughter flagged me down. AW = annoying woman, TD = Teenage daughter MF = my friend 


AW Hey, HEY. I’ve been here twenty minutes already, can I get some service please? 


ME: Oh, so I don’t work here, but I can go find my friend—


AW: Just because this isn’t your section doesn’t mean you can’t help me, this place isn’t that big. 


ME: Oh, haha, no I don’t work here at all. 


AW: Come on, what, you’re going on break? 


ME: No, miss, I am not employed by this store. 


AW: Are you going to help me or not? 


ME: Did you hear anything I just said? 


*shocked look*


AW: I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER OF THIS CHAIN FOR DECADES. IF YOU DON’T HELP ME YOU’LL NEVER HAVE MY BUSINESS AGAIN. 


ME: Unless you needed digital editing done, I didn’t have your business to begin with. 


My friend hears the commotion and comes over. 


MF: Hey what can I help with? 


AW: Your employee has been very rude to me and my daughter, he.... uh... he cursed us and everything! My daughter heard it, right sweetie? I shop here all the time and there isn’t a discount big enough to fix this, I need to speak to a manager or a manager’s manager or something. 


TD: Yah!


My friend knows pretty much the only remains of my Christian upbringing is I still never curse. Instinctually, I’ll be a “gosh, golly, darn” person until I die. So, he put together pretty quickly what had happened. 

Important thing to know, I look kind of like Aaron Paul. My friend and I had just been discussing it earlier in the day because of El Camino coming out. 


MF: Wait... I knew I recognized you! Sir, oh my God, it’s such an honor to meet you. 


(I didn’t know what he was doing at this point.) 


AW: Are you talking to him?


She turns to me 



AW: Are you the owner or something?  


MF: Can I get a photo with you Aaron? 


ME: Alright, but make it quick, I’m just trying to pick out a new couch I don’t want a lot of attention. 


AW: Who are you?? 


MF: Ma’m are you kidding? This is Aaron Paul. You know. Jesse Pinkman, from Breaking Bad? From the El Camino movie on Netflix??


TD: AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO WAAAAAAY!!!!!!! AAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! 


MF: Oh but... Mr. Paul Sir... did you... did you curse at my patrons? I guess I’m going to have to ask you to leave the store, I mean, it’s policy if you were bothering people....


TD: NO! NO NONE OF THAT HAPPENED AT ALL. MY MOM MADE THAT UP BECAUSE SHE WAS EMBARRASSED. Can I take a photo with you?? 


ME: I don’t really like to do a lot of—


MF: Sure you can honey, I’ll take the photo, give me your phone.  Squeeze in Mr. Paul! 


My friend is barely holding it together but I felt bad looping the teenage daughter into this... 

But then HER MOM GETS IN THE PHOTO! And puts her arm around me like we’re friends! No apology or anything at any point from her. So I didn’t feel bad anymore. 

We took a bunch of photos, then as soon as I had an opportunity, I went home, because people were already starting to whisper throughout the store that Aaron Paul was in there buying a couch. In that short period of time I already had to correct two people who stopped me on my way out. 

Caught up with my friend a few hours later and apparently the woman picked out a ton of mattress covers, then tried to pay for them in part with an expired coupon, pitched a major fit over the coupon not being accepted, and eventually left without buying anything.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dis4vk/just_because_im_wearing_blue_and_know_a_lot_about/,"Just because im wearing blue and know a lot about computers dosent mean I work here About 6 months ago I decided to upgrade my laptop since I've had the same one for 5 years after lots of research I found one that I loved within my price range. I drove to the technology stores around me to price which stores would give me the best deal.  

I walk into a blue tech store since I saw they had a sale and after talking about the specs with my friend some lady grabs my shoulder and tries to turn me around and starts yelling at me saying ""she has been trying to find an employee for the longest time to help her grab a TV"". 

I turn around and say with the most monotone voice "" I don't work here lady just because im wearing blue doesn't give you the right to yell at me because you can't find one of the many employees in this store.""

She gets red and decides to double down on the assumption that I work there and yells for a manager, and one walks by and looked at me and laughed and said: ""I don't know this guy he obviously doesn't work here."" The lady gets even redder and then walks to the other side of the store I assume to harass other people who do not work there."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/diwi4n/sorry_sir_im_not_a_manager_im_just_a_hostess/,"Sorry Sir, I'm not a manager, I'm just a hostess! So this story happened about a month ago and I thought it'd be fun to share here.  I thought it would fit here because even though I am an employee at this place, I was mistaken for an employee of an entirely different department and position and thought it'd count.

I work at a resort restaurant as a hostess, but often work in other positions because my boss believes in having a bunch of skills.  I'm basically an UNO wildcard to this restaurant and I do enjoy it.  I get a variety of jobs to my schedule, a great and fair pay for each of them, and learn a lot of different skills that help me outside of restaurant business.

Our restaurant is in the main building of the resort, meaning the majority of resort employees can be found here either dropping something off, working in their offices, or passing through for some maintenance job.  Every employee has their own unique uniform based on their department and a nametag with their name and hometown/home country listed.  The only exceptions are the managers and hosts/hostesses who are really only supposed to wear good looking clothes and their nametag.  The managers are the only employees who have their positions listed on their name tags.  On days when I'm hostess, I usually just wear a dress or a dress shirt and nice pants.  On this particular day, I wore the shirt and pants - a combo most managers at the resort also wear.

So my story begins on a Sunday evening in early October.  The resort is pretty empty as most guests have gone home and it was the time of day where most people don't go eating lunch/dinner.  I was working as a hostess this day and my boss, the lead manager of the restaurant, was hanging around my stand because he didn't have much to do.  He even revealed that he was ""bored"" and was looking for something to do.  At one point, he noticed a bunch of people in our pool outside (Yes, people still went swimming in October.  We're in Texas), and told me I should go see if they wanted any food or drinks from the bar as the pool's server wasn't on duty today (basically me).  I leapt at the chance because I didn't want to stand around doing nothing for hours and any opportunity for tip money is greatly appreciated.  At one point, I asked an older gentleman if he wanted anything to eat or drink.  He said he wanted to wait as his wife was about to come and was probably hungrier than him.  I offered to give him more time before I would come back, but he stopped me before I could leave, asking if he could make a request.  I stayed to listen because I like to help the restaurant however I can.

He started giving me his story about how a bartender serving him the previous night had difficulties getting his room charge to work.  This is a common issue with guests at the resort as it could either be their card was declined, they exceeded the credit they put on their account, a tech issue, or a slip up caused by the front desk.  The servers bypass it by calling in a request, but to get it fixed, the front desk has to do it.   But the issue the old man had wasn't with the charge, but the amount of time the bartender had to wait to get through to the front desk.  He mentioned how the bartender was put on hold around 2 times and kept there for around 10-15 minutes.  The old man had tried asking the bartender to just use his card as he didn't want to cause trouble for the guy.

I asked the old man what the request he had was, and he brightened up by asking if we would ""fix the phone system for this particular issue.""  I was confused as I thought he was talking about a restaurant issue and told him we weren't able to do it.  He looked a bit confused and said ""but you could tell one of your managers about the issue, right?  After all, I'm sure the managers that work for you must know someone who can fix the issue.""  That's when I started to realize that the old man must have thought I was a manager.  I told him I was only the hostess of the restaurant and didn't actually have any managerial duties.  He looked confused for a moment before saying ""I just thought you were a manager!  You sure look like one and you look like you know what you're doing.""

Just hearing this made me laugh like crazy.  I'm a 22 year old woman who's only 5'0"" tall and often gets mistaken as a 16 year old.  I've only worked in restaurant business for a total of 5 months and the only business experience I have is what I learned from Shark Tank, a economics class, and a business law class.  I've never been thought of as a manager before, yet this man thought I was one of the managers of the RESORT, not just one department.  I was actually pretty flattered.

We both laughed about it before I excused myself to check on my hostess stand again.  I did take his order later when his wife was there.  The two of them were very sweet people and told me their story of how they did nearly EVERYTHING that day as a cold front was coming in the next day.  They asked me about myself, what I wanted to do in the future, and then gave me some encouragement that I really needed.  The tip was also pretty nice also. ;)

No big nuclear ending.  No Karens demanding I be fired.  Just a kind old man thinking that I was a manager and laughing about his mistake.  It's just an encounter that made me smile and I hope it does for you all as well."

So my mom took me out to get our nails done at a nail and hair salon in my hometown. After I got my nails done, I sat in one of the waiting chairs, and an older man walks in and asks me. 

""Are you the hair dresser?""

I told him no just as the actual hairdresser walked up to us. I don't think he was a bad guy, if anything he probably was just confused and is really just a sweet old man. Thanks for reading."

I'm over at my parents' place and on my laptop when the house phone rings. My dad gets it and I hear a conversation that goes something like this:

**My dad:** ""Who's this?... You called us... No, you called us... no, you called us... no one from here called you!"" <Hangs up>

I was half-listening and half working on some code at the time so I asked him what that was about. He said some lady was insistent that someone from here had called her and she was demanding to know who and why. He was more bewildered than anything at this lady's insistence, and a bit annoyed.

I told him a telemarketer probably called her and spoofed our number. I shrugged the call off and went back to coding.

I thought that was the end of it until the phone rang again about 2 minutes later. He saw the caller ID said ""private caller"" and gave it to me and said, ""Here, you take it. You have all the answers.""

I took the phone and started the call.

**Me:** Hello?

**Lady:** That was very rude of you to hang up on me while I was talking to you!

**Me:** Uh, I have never spoken to you before.

**Lady:** Well whoever I was talking to! You're very rude! Why did you call me?

**Me:** No-one here called you. I think what probably happened is a telemarketer called you and spoofed our number and -

**Lady:** Don't you return phone calls!? I get 100 calls a day I don't have time to spend my time returning all of these! Who called me from here?

**Me:** Lady, again, no one here called you! You were talking to my dad earlier and he already told you -

**Lady:** (starts ranting more or less of the same, getting louder and louder)

**Me:** (*Finally losing my patience.*) LADY! No one here called you but I can see why my dad hung up on you BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY ANNOYING! <*Hangs up*>

This isn't an exact word-for-word and I think there was a bit more I'm forgetting but it's close enough.

Jebus, I could hear the ""I want to speak to your manager"" vibe in her voice and was 99% sure her name was actually Karen. Too bad for her this isn't a store and I have no problem hanging up on her. 

If she's too stupid to believe no one called her and expects a more satisfactory answer she's in for a world of disappointment."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/diil7m/i_dont_work_here_because_the_place_is_closed/,"I don't work here because the place is CLOSED. Not certain this story is quite a fit, if not, please feel free to tell me to go to heck.

A close friend of mine used to run a motorcycle junkyard and repair shop.  His father started the business, they were active for a really long time, their family owns the land, and my friend lives in a mobile home on the property the shop / yard was at.  But eventually there came a point, between eBay and other online stuff, where it was costing just about as much to keep the business open as they were making, so my friend shut the place down and sold off the entire collection from the back yard in one lot.

I needed shop space, the repair bay wasn't being used any more, so I asked if I could rent the shop space.  We talked it over with his mom (who is the legal owner of the land and building) and came to an agreement as to terms regarding rent and utilities.  I and my shop partner moved in.

There is a sign in the front window, next to the side door that leads to the shop bay, which states ""$FORMER\_SHOP\_NAME IS NO LONGER IN BUSINESS, AS OF $DATE"".

For the first year or two, it was kinda funny, if a bit aggravating.  People would stop by nearly every day, park directly in front of the clearly visible sign, come into the shop where E. or I were working, and ask if we had a part for whatever motorcycle.

In fact, someone came by today, and did the exact same thing.

It's no longer amusing.  On the 31st of October this year, the shop will have been closed for **SIX YEARS**.  That's right, the sign clearly states that the shop has been out of business since October 31, 2013.

No, dude, as a matter of fact, I *don't* have ""just that one little part"" for whatever Honda you have.  No, I won't go check, because the bike shop is *gone*.  Kaput.  It is an ex-shop.

They don't stop by every day, any longer, at least, but still.  The shop has been closed for nearly six years.  It's not in the phone book, or the online phone directories.  It's not even on Google Maps any more.  And they always park **right** in front of the sign.

Now i work a six flags, and the uniforms for team members are blue polo and either black pants for foods tan pants for games retail etcetera.
Im also really into guns and seeing as i cant own a real one i own some air soft guns, and recently had gotten a flashlight grip for one of them, and didn’t get batteries for it so checking on amazon seeing which ones it took I decided to go to Walmart after work.
It was also hot as balls that day, so I wasn’t wearing a normal t-shirt under my uniform and said f it whats the worst that could happen (i was also listening to music).

I walk in, and go over to the battery’s at the front and cant find them, so I decided to go over to the back of the store to see if there was any back there,  sure enough there is so i grab them and afterwards go to the board games, to see if i could find uno flip did and grabbed that and started to head to where the shaving cream is.

Then this lady comes down the aisle 

Lady: excuse me?

Me:*lip syncing country music while looking for sensitive shaving gel*

Lady: hellooo? (Snaps fingers) 

Me: *still lip syncing country music*

Lady: ughhh (takes my headphones) what the .... what the hell are you listening to?

Me: no i- 

Lady: and shouldn’t you be wearing a name tag

Me: (the sarcastic p.o.s i am) yeah I should wear a name tag to a place i don’t work at

Lady: go get your manager!

Me: I DONT WORK HERE LADY!

I was trying to be nice and make a meal for him since he said he hadn't had a homemade meal for a while. He can cook, he had just been too busy with work and it's super expensive on any coast. The food I was going to make him needed bacon bits so while he was at work I went to go find some at a nearby store. 


As it turns out bacon bits are a more midwestern item. I looked around the salad making products and couldn't find any so thought my next option would be spices. It was here I made my dreadful mistake. One that I'm still embarrassed about to this day.


When I found the spices I looked on my own for a bit and couldn't find them and happened to notice a woman with a cart full of stuff. She put some things back and I wrongfully assumed she worked there. So I asked her;


Me: excuse me, do you know where I can find the bacon bits?


Lady: what?


Me: bacon bits?


Lady: *looking really confused but still smiling* I don't know what that is...


Y'all. Just then it hit me. This really nice lady, didn't work there. She had no name tag, was not putting things away, and was not a connoisseur of bacon. No, no pork at all for this lady, because ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that's when her head scarf hit me. This woman is Muslim. And I,... am a certifiable dumbass. I apologized quickly and made my way to the meat section to make bacon bits myself. I know I was probably overthinking it but I really felt bad like I had unintentionally insulted her.

So I’m on the phone with my sister walking through the aisles when I notice a lady staring directly into my soul, with her arms crossed and tapping her foot. I kinda lowered my phone and looked and her and she walked over to me.

I am a regular shopper at \*insert 'Store' Chain\* and my closet is full of clothes from there. I normally wear black basic and a sweater or something on top.So one fateful day, I am on vacation in another city far from home, and got to 'Store' to buy some new tops.

Not only did OP2 and me look veeeeery similar, we could have been twins (except I have birthmarks on my face and she didn't), but we also coincidentally wore the same set of clothes, except the shoes.

SM unhanded me and apologized, 'OP2 started working there not long ago, so she didn't recognize the small differences'

I calmed down a bit and just left. Later at the food corner of the mall the store was in, I met OP2 again.She apologized again for SMs behavior and told me people already complained about her and that she wasn't really popular around the other employees either. We exchanged contact infos and saw each other a few times after, but sadly we drifted apart.

But yeah that wraps up the story of how I had my very first 'I don't work here' story and found my doppelgänger :)

I walked in a Best Buy by myself while my brother was in the car. I ran in there to get what he wanted. There I was wearing A blue shirt (it wasn't polo or buttoned up, just a normal T-shirt) with brown joggers on. I can see how she may have gotten me confused with a worker as I do look like them. When I got there I went straight to the electronics department. I was there checking for the game he wanted (Cod WW2. IDK why he wanted it even though it is pretty old). 

The woman (Karen) walks up to me and starts asking where a certain game for her son was. The conversation went as followed.

Karen: Hello, Best Buy worker, My son is looking for (a game I forgot the name of).  

Me: Oh I'm sorry I don't work here, but I can show you where it is

Karen: \*makes the most surprising face ever\* WHAT, but you are wearing the uniform. Don't lie to me. Just take me to where I ""need"" to go.

Me: Mam I'm not going to take you since you are acting to rude. 

I didn't walk away from the isle, but I basically made a lap around it. Apparently, Karen followed me the whole way because when I got back, she was right behind me. She then decided to ""discipline me"" and tell me about how much of a liar I was. She then decided to use racial profiling and started insulting my life. Here is how it went...

Karen: You are going to show me where it is you (I don't want to get banned)

Me: Mam, I'm 14 and I don't work. That would be illegal. Now if you would please get awa---

Karen: \*cuts me off\* Listen here you \*\*\*\*\*\* you are going to take me to the aisle right now, or I will have your job.

Me: Don't you have something better to do

After that I see my brother walking into Best Buy. I thought ""oh thank god, someone is gonna save me from a crazy lady"".

She keeps ranting me on how dumb I was and how she was going to take my job. The weird thing is I haven't seen her child once. My brother sees her and walks in front of me. The conversation went as followed.

Brother: WOAH WOAH, What is going on over here. 

Karen: Finally, the manager. You need to fire this employee. He is being disrespectful to the customer and he is not doing what I have asked of him.

Brother: You know what, Your fired Me, You have done this too much you lazy bum.

I got confused for a while before I realized how it made Karen look and I went along with the acting. 

Me: OK fine. \*I take COD WW2, Buy it, and walk into the car.

The whole time Karen was looking dumbfounded because I just bought a game, and I sat in the passenger's seat, not the driver's seat. My brother hops in and drives away with me. I'm glad I wiped that poop-eating grin off of Karen's face. I have never seen her since.

    Karen: What the [frick] ??? According to Google, y'all are open! And I NEED my mocha-choca-frappe- pretentious-latte!

    Me: I really do apologies for any inconvenience, but we arent able to adjust what Google says. I'm only 16 and I dont run our website. 

    K: So who's gonna make my [complicated drink]??

    Me: Well the store that way [points East] is usually open later, you can likely catch them. I'd gladly make you your drink, but we can't let anybody in while the safe is open, and our machines are down anyways. 

    It was at this point that the veins on her neck and forehead had swelled to an unhealthy level and had turned purple. It was as if she were smuggling eggplants in her facelift, and I didnt want to stay there as they burst. 

    K: I want you to call your manager right this instant! 

    It was now about 10, and there was NO way I was going to wake her up to appease  some relentless dragon. I tried to explain to her [as kindly as possible, mind you] that my boss had to be up at 3am, and I couldnt get her up if I wanted to. After 5 minutes of her threatening my job to talk to my manager, she finally settled for my regional manager's phone number under the assumption shed wait till morning to call. 

    As I went inside to get her a business card she had hopped back into her entitlement chariot, sat her entire whale-weight onto the car's horn for 15ish seconds, screamed intense profanities at me and my coworker, and sped off at full throttle. 

    From my memory she cursed pretty much through the whole conversation despite my limited inclusion of it in the script, and I never saw her again. I hope she never got her latte."

So was out clothes shopping a few days ago and I was in a shop where the main colour in the shop is noticeably blue. And I was wearing a blue shirt of a somewhat similar shade. I had just tried on a coat and looked in the mirror when I noticed a couple who were also clothes shopping too. 


I finished admiring myself in the public mirror and decided to take it off and put it back. As I walked away with my blue shirt exposed and carrying a coat in a hanger I hear a man (will be known as M) and woman (will be known as W) almost simultaneously say “excuse me”



I turn around just to make sure they weren’t talking to me and sure enough they were.


As I’m not too bad with confrontation I happily walk up to them and say “yes?”


The conversation goes thusly:


M: “Hello” (instantly notices how young I am)


M: “You don’t work here do you?”


Me: “Nope”


M: “oops”


W: “oh sorry”


And we went our separate ways. I do get how he could’ve thought I worked there considering my shirt and height for my age.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dhx0ul/ii_dont_work_sir_mumbles/,"I....I dont work sir -mumbles- Hi I've read lost of stories on Reddit and decided to post my own. 

Just a note there was no Karen and this couple was very nice about it. 

Also I pretty shy around strangers and tend to speak in a low voice or not at all if they speak to me. On to the short story. 

I had just gotten off work from a Dollar Store. And decided to head to Walmart to buy a few stuff with my mom. While at Walmart I tend to walk off without my mom knowing. Since I can easily call her to find out where she is in the store. I venture off to the electronics section grab what I need then head back to my mom. Here is where the interaction starts. 

Just to tell you my job uniform is a green shirt with black (or khaki) pants. I was wearing black pants. As everyone knows Walmart employees wear blue vest. I was not dressed as an Walmart employee. While heading to my mom I ran into the couple. 

Husband: excuse me miss do you know where the blinds are?

My mind draws a blank for a second, I quickly start to talk. 

Me: I....I don't work....here sir -mumbles-

Husband: you know the window blinds

Me: I dont-

Wife: -she interruptes me but wasn't rude about it- she doesn't work here 

Husband: -realizes my uniform doesn't match Walmarts- oh I'm sorry! You look so professional -chuckles- 

Me: its ok...dont worry 

And then we walk off in different directions. I was figuring why they would think I work here. So I looked down at my shirt. Low and behold I'm still wearing my name tag. I mentally faceplam and take it off. I laugh at my stupidity for not taking it off like I usually do. 

I eventually found my mom and tell her what happens. She laughs with me. 

I'm pretty thankful it wasn't a rude Karen. If it was I would of probably broke down crying hoping for my mom to come in and save me. I'm not good with confrontation at all! 

Thanks for reading! XD"

I had made some cheesecakes earlier that day and it was about 9pm when my housemates all of which were up for some odd reason were annoying me for cheesecake. So I got my butt out of bed annoyed as I had go somewhere early in the morning. I was cutting up the cheesecakes and dishing them out when my roommate came screaming though the house. Not sure how to describe it, but she was clearly off. Maybe it was the fact she accused me of trying to murder her while I was cutting up cheesecake or how she threw a clock at my head. Not the first time she went off. 

The oldest of my housemates ushered us all outside so my roommate could go 50 shades of crazy inside. She dialed 911. She told them what was going on. And shortly two cops showed up in a cop car. They asked us whom was going nuts and we pointed inside. Which lead to a rather strange moment with my roommate running outside yelling ""You'll never take me alive!!!"" before diving into a mud puddle as if it was a pool. The cops promptly picked her up and dragged her back inside.

""Did she think that was a pool??"" I asked confused.

""Most likely. mmm, I love this cheesecake."" said my housemate.

I looked back at her. ""Ya still have it?"" I asked

""You are holding the spoon still."" she said pointing

I noticed the spoon having forgotten I was holding it and started to eat the cheesecake off it. After a bit the cops came back out and the one turned to me and said ""Are you her nurse?""

""What?"" I asked 

""Are you her nurse? She needs her meds."" said the one cop.

I stared at him. ""No. I live here."" I replied

""Are you sure?"" said the cop

""Pretty sure. Why do you think I am a nurse?"" I asked

""You are dressed like one.""

I looked at my self. ""I am wearing pjs. My hair is a mess, I have no shoes, and I am licking a spoon. I am clearly not a nurse. Please try the landlord.""

""Thought you were, you look professional."" said the cop before going to the landlord's office. I hushed my housemates to keep them from laughing as I could see they wanted to. After a bit, paramedics came and took my roommate away to get meds. The cops then left.

My landlord came out and stared at me. ""They asked me Why the nurse was saying she wasn't a nurse. Okay, whose the nurse this time?"" she asked.  my housemates pointed to me. Yes we all got a laugh out of it. And everyone turned out fine later."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dh80zk/she_was_fully_aware_i_didnt_work_there_but_was/,"She was fully aware I didn't work there but was unlikely to get help otherwise TL;DR at the bottom

Background:  I consider myself deaf, though I'm really just severely hard of hearing.  I don't like wearing my hearing aids because after a while my ears get sweaty and gets a little uncomfortable.  Think about it like wearing cheap earbuds in for a while, same experience.  I just happened to have my hearing aids in because I tend to like being able to catch more of what I miss and allows me to have better conversations without needing to sign.  However, in public, I tend to do what's called comsign which is signing while I'm speaking.  It's out of habit more than conscious effort.  

The Story:  This is in no way what seems typical for this subreddit, as it doesn't end with a spectacular finale.  My Roommate and I were shopping at Wally World, just getting a few items like milk, diet soda, stuff I missed for burrito night, etc.  I was wearing a dark gray shirt, black slacks, black shoes, black socks, glasses, hearing aids.  Roommate was also not wearing close to the colors either, gray sweatpants and a black shirt with two wolves on it.  So no way we could potentially be mistaken for employees.

Well, coincidentally, it wasn't being mistaken for employees, but the fact that I was speaking with my voice and signing.  I wasn't paying attention to this gal, probably about 20, however my Roommate had noticed her and she signed ""Help me"".  My roomie who needs signing slowed down for him still asks me vocally to direct my attention at the lady.  She signs again ""Help me"".  I sign ""How help you"".

Biggest smile ever in the universe.  She signs that she knows I don't work here, but she needed help to speak to the store manager about coupons for batteries for cochlear implants.  I sign to her telling her that I think Walmart accepts coupons for their competitors but I'm not sure but I think a regular employee would know since they're trained for it.  And that's exactly what we do.

Roomie and I stopped our shopping, went up front to the cashier and I asked the question of the century for this gal.

Me:  Do you guys accept competitor coupons for things like hearing aid batteries?

Cashier:  I believe we do, but I'm new so let me just make sure.

At this point the cashier calls for a CSM (Customer Service Manager) who shows up less than a minute away.

CSM: What's the problem?

Cashier:  Can we accept coupons like this for hearing aid batteries?

CSM: Yes, if it doesn't scan just do a price match and put it in your drawer.

Meanwhile during their conversation I'm signing to the deaf lady with the dead battery having CI what's being said.

I sign to her to go pick up her batteries and point to where they are.

She runs back in a couple minutes while my roomie and I were chatting with the cashier, mostly about cats.  Cashier rings up the batteries, applies to coupon, deaf lady pays and immediately uses a battery in her processor.  She then thanks us and hands me a dollar.

Off she runs, into the night.  We've seen each other before numerous times over the last 3 years of me living here at that store, and other places around town, but this is the first time I've personally interacted with her.  Roomie and I finish our shopping and end up at the cashier again (It was late at night so take what you will).

There's no assault, no sense of entitlement, no police involvement, no screaming/yelling/crying.  Just a deaf gal with a CI that needed some brief help being able to communicate with the hearing world while out of batteries.

EXTRA EXTRA READ ALL ABOUT IT!

I'm going to cut in with some things that I think may come up in comments.

Before you ask about the title as to why she wouldn't have been able to get help otherwise, while it's true that with her CI she'd be able to hear, but how well is up to the person, and her batteries were dead so no sound until she put the batteries into the processor.  So she was completely deaf, and lip reading is still difficult even for me while I can catch things like vowels, it's pretty bad when you're completely deaf.  Think of ""Bad Lip Reading"" on YouTube.  My Roommate and I were the middlemen for her being able to communicate with people.

And why didn't she just ""Speak""?  I know for a fact she is able to, but she has a major deaf accent according to my roommate (I didn't hear her well but he could).  There's also this thing that many hearies have that are complete myths that are still believed today even unfortunately by hospital staff like nurses and doctors.  Stuff like ""Deaf people can't talk"", ""All deaf people sign"", things like that.  Admittedly this is also why when I go to a store by myself, I immediately become ""mute"" by choice so that I don't have to deal with the BS.  So I'm thinking her reasoning is so she too didn't have to deal with the same BS.  Regardless speaking and getting spoken back to, doesn't help, she's deaf and had no sound at the time.

It's true that I speak and I speak very, very well largely due to years of speech therapy and having hearing aids as a child, this isn't the case for everyone as each person has differing levels of what they can and cannot hear.  While I'm comfortable with how well I speak verbally, not everyone is, so some people with a CI are still likely to sign due to knowing how their voice sounds.  So that's a confidence thing.

Why didn't she just try the coupon with the batteries instead of getting someone that could help her communicate?  I'm pretty sure she just happened to see me rather than going out of her way to look for me.  So it's easier for her to sign to me requesting help than it is to potentially get to the register with her stuff and not be able to hear the employee say if the coupon could be used or not.  This could also be a confidence thing too, having at least some level of being able to communicate with hearies back and forth while her CI was out of commission (due to batteries).

Why did she give me a buck if she was looking to save the money?  The coupon she had saved her a little over $2 on her batteries and it was a damn good coupon, so major score.  I guess she saved enough from it and wanted to tip me for being her middleman in communication.  I know I've been in scenarios where I would turn my hearing aids off until I know I was being spoken to then turn them on in effort to save on batteries because I was on my last set and couldn't get more for another day or two away.

Didn't any of the employees know how to sign?  I know for a fact there are a couple cashiers and one stocker that at least knows basic signing and can say stuff like ""Hi"" ""My name is \_\_\_\_"" ""have a good day"" etc, but their knowledge is nowhere near the point of being able to assist with signing beyond that without resort to slowly (painfully slow) spelling.  Like ""W ......H... A ......T (hamster wheel spinning) Y ..... O (30 seconds later) U"".  I generally commend someone for knowing the ASL alphabet well enough that low speech bandwidth of just spelling everything rapidly is better than no signing at all.  This is true for most deafies in a hearing environment.

That's all I can think of.

Moral of the story:  Not everyone that asks for help thinks you're an employee, some know for a fact that you're not but still request help.  You also may be the only person in the entire store (even counting the employees) that is able to help quickly and reliably.

TL;DR:  Deaf woman with cochlear implants with dead batteries had a coupon for another store and needed it for batteries, needed help communicating with hearies and thus signed for help.  We helped her communicate to get the answer she wanted.  She got her batteries, paid for them, tipped me and left super happy."

 So this story starts with my dad pulling into a gas station while we were on a roadtrip, I had to go to the bathroom so I ran inside while my dad put a bit of air in the tires and got gas. As soon as I step out of the bathroom Karen looks at me and Says ""Finally someone who works here, done with your extended break yet"" 

I looked at her and said the famous line ""I don't work here-"" 

Karen cut me off and said ""I know you work here I saw you talking with that man outside"" 

I'm pretty short and obviously young so I have no idea how she even mistook me for an employee so I repeat again ""I don't work here"" To which she SLAMS THE DOOR (glass)   of the gas station which promptly shattered. 

My dad heard this and immediately ran to the store. 
Dad ""What is happening here"" 

Karen ""THIS EMPLOYEE REFUSES TO HELP ME AND CLAIMS HE DOESNT WORK HERE I WANT HIM FIRED"" 

At this point a real employee comes out of the backroom to see what's happening. When the employee realizes the door is broken she calls the owner who arives in the middle of the my dad and I telling Karen that I don't work there and am 13. 
 
The owner shows up and tells her the exact same things we said to which karen decides to yell 
""WHY ARE YOU DEFFENDING THIS EMPLOYEE HE WAS LAZY AND SHOULD BE FIRED"" followed by her throwing a bunch of stuff from an aisle on the ground and storming out. 

We ended up getting free snacks and saw Karen's car on the side of the highway being pulled over by the cops. We made sure to slow down and give her a nice wave when we drove by. Thanks for the free snacks lady."

So first, a little bit of background, I work in customer service, and I'm one of the rare folks who *enjoy* my job, lord knows how I ended up rolling that successfully, but said business has a bright orange shirt with the business name on the front in white as the uniform.

So, This happened a few days back (So sorry if something ended up inaccurate), I was on my lunch and I went to the local yellow M's for my usual intake of calories and regret. I opted to go inside rather than use the drive-thru as it was, at the time, double-loaded with cars.

Now note, I'm very tech-savvy, I'm on my computer when I'm not working or sleeping, and there was a time in my life where I relied on the free wifi that came with the golden arches, so I had an inkling that I would know what the hell I was talking about if someone asked.

As I'm going inside, there's a woman hanging over her phone, and when she saw me she spoke up

Me - you guessed it

CL- Confused Lady

\----

***CL: Excuse me, I'm having issues with connecting to the wifi***

Initially, her tone was a little demanding but I could understand it was probably frustration and I wasn't dealing with a Karen, plus my customer service programming kicked in and I answered automatically

***Me: Try turning your wifi off n' on and reconnecting***

***CL: Okay, thank you.***

Fast forward five minutes. I've ordered, got my number and my drink (tropic berry is good stuff), and I've sat down where I can see the kitchen. I've zoned out a tad when I hear it

***CL: Excuse me, I have a few more questions.***

Lo and behold, the 8/10 nice but confused lady.

So I'm back in customer service mode, she pulls up a chair and I give her a smile, since hey, wifi issues suck and she's not a *total* donkey. She explains to me that she's trying to meet someone there and she's trying to contact them with her phone but due to the wifi not working she is unable to send her messages.

I'm running my usual troubleshooting when she says the magic words that make this all a misunderstanding.

***CL: I'm so sorry, I don't have my glasses so I cant see what I'm doing.***

Figured. I could understand the case however so I just give her a smile, a soft laugh, and the classic line we've all heard before

***Me: I can tell, Ma'am. I don't actually work here.***

Rather than going supernova like we've seen many a Karen do, she grew very apologetic. So I was happy to help her until my number was called. At this moment I had to apologize and tell her I had to go, but she understood. I wished her best of luck, took my food, and ollied out to get back to my workplace for my favorite parking spot.

I realize now that I think about it that she was trying to use a data-service, Wi-Fi wouldn't have done squat for her, but I hope she found her friend.

So yeah, that's my first incident with an IDWH-Moment. Nothing bad happened but the worlds gotta have some good in it, am I right?

I work for Family store and we're next door to Food store. When I got off I went grocery shopping. Maybe, 10 mins into my shopping trip I walk down the juice aisle, a lady walks up to me completely missing the basket full of groceries I'm pushing and asks if we carry apple juice. She's holding apple juice, I'm confused. I think she sees it in my face. She says ""I'm sorry cider, not juce."" Then she realizes I'm shopping and says sorry, again. I tell her i work for Family store and I'm not sure I can help her. She says thanks anyway and we part ways.

 I finish my shopping trip maybe another 20-25 mins later, after going down every aisle, and get in line behind an unattended basket. Then she appears, the same lady. I asked if she found it. She said ""no, and I thought they would have it, being this time of year,"" ""I'm just gonna use apple juice and vinegar?!"" Almost asking me if it sounded ok, I have no idea. But, I know for a fact this store has cider, as I've mistaken it for apple juice before. Yuck! So we troubleshoot together where it could be, we're waiting in line for awhile because it's really busy. 

We can't figure it out so I tell her she can ask the cashier and she can find out where it is. She asks and we hear another associate say ""it's behind you,"" talking to the cashier, so the lady and I both look and we find it in the produce section in crates under the apples.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dgkqs1/woman_mistakes_me_for_an_employee_throws_a/,"Woman mistakes me for an employee, throws a tantrum among other things Recently, I went to a grocery store. The store is a popular chain in my area. Most of the employees wear redish polo shirts with black aprons or vests over them. Some just wear unbranded dress shirts or have dress codes unique to their department (like the coat worn by people in the meat department). I was wearing a black polo with a small logo for my OT clinic. This must have confused one of the other customers.

I was picking up some ingredients for a bake sale going on at the grade school my girls attend. My wife was not only the organizer, she was baking four items to include in the sale. Since she was at home preparing cookies and brownies, I was sent to get more essentials like sugar and frosting.

 In the baking isle, I was kneeling down to reach the large bags of sugar that are always on the bottom shelf. I was reaching towards the back of the bottom shelf since there weren't many bags left. While doing this, I was being careful not to over exert my right hand since I recently had to get stitches and it still hurt (cut it with a razor while helping to set up a neighborhood Haunted House). 

 That's when I heard a high pitched voice say, “I'll find it myself!” I thought the voice was unnecessarily loud but didn't really give it a second thought as I grabbed the bag and lifted it up to my cart. I placed it on the handle on top of the cart for a moment to give my hand a rest when a woman grabbed the bag off of my cart, put it in her own and said, “Great! I don't have to go looking for it now!” 

 It was the same voice and before I could react, she happily walked away and was out of sight as soon as she turned at the end of the isle. 

 There was nothing for me to do but bend down again and start the process over to get the last bag of sugar. 

 After getting butter and eggs from the back of the store, I went through the condiments isle to get to the front. The moment I entered the isle, I saw the woman. I wanted to to see if she would say anything as I walked by but she was occupied with another customer. 

 “**Siiiiiiir**!” the woman's voice was so loud and piercing, it literally made me stop in my tracts for a moment. “Could you help me reach the ketchup? I need ketchup.” She pointed to the top shelf that held the larger sizes of ketchup bottles. 

 She didn't see me yet. She was speaking to an elderly gentleman who was walking with the aid of a cane. “They're too far back!” the woman exclaimed. 

 “I wish I could help you,” the man replied, “but I don't think I'll have anymore luck than you.” The man wasn't much taller the woman. 

 “But I can't reach the ketchup and I **neeeeed** it!” 

 Fearing that she would not leave the man alone, I stepped in, “I'll get the ketchup for you, ma'am.” Reaching up was much easier than getting under a shelf. I could easily use my left hand to grab a bottle for the lady. 

 She looked over her shoulder at me and then turned back to the gentleman, “Let the employee get it!” Again, her voice was loud as if she were trying to speak over some ambient noise that only she could hear. 

 “I'm not an employee, ma'am.” 

 The lady turned around to face me, “But I need some ketchup.” 

 “I'll help you get the ketchup.” 

 “Do you work here?” 

 “No,” I replied. 

 “Why do you want the ketchup?” 

 “I don't want any ketchup. I'm trying to help you.” 

 “I need ketchup,” she pointed to the top shelf again. 

 “I know,” I said, failing to hide the frustration in my voice. 

 I had to reach over her outstretched arm, but I grabbed the bottle that she appeared to be pointing at. I tried to hand the bottle to her but she looked at it in my hand and said, “That's not **biiiiig** enough. I need the big ketchup.” 

 I sighed and put the bottle back before picking up a 64oz bottle. 

 “The lid is on *top*!” the woman whined. 

 “What?” I asked, thoroughly confused. 

 “The lid is on the top of the ketchup. I need the ketchup with the lid on the *bottom*!” 

 “You said you wanted the big one. There are only two choices: a 64oz bottle with the lid on top or a 32oz bottle with an inverted lid.” 

 “I need the big ketchup with the lid on the bottom!” 

 I summoned patience I didn't know that I had, “Perhaps you should get two of the 32oz bottles with the lid on the bottom.” I put the larger bottle back and picked up the inverted ketchup bottle. When I held the bottle out for her to take, she just stared at it. So I put it in her cart (next to the large bag of sugar) and grabbed a second bottle. This one she took from me. 

 “**I NEED THE BIG KETCHUP!**” This time the woman really yelled. “**THIS** ***ISN'T*** **THE** ***BIG*** **KETCHUP! I NEED THE BIG KETCHUP!**” 

 She drew the attention of the entire store including several employees that curiously looked in from the end of the isle. 

 “I'm sorry,” I said, “I don't think I can help you with your ketchup problem anymore.” 

 As I reached for my cart, the woman threw the bottle of ketchup at me! I reacted by deflecting it away with my sutured hand. 

 “Ah!” I exclaimed in pain. The bottle went flying into the shelf on the opposite side of the ketchup display with a loud cracking sound. Ketchup sprayed all over the products on the shelf. The lid of the bottle had cracked and broke off on impact. 

 “What's going on here!” A woman who appeared to be the manager stepped up from behind the other employees. 

 “**HE DOESN'T WORK HERE!**” the obnoxious woman yelled. 

 “Ma'am, calm down,” the manager said, trying to get the lady to quiet down. “Tell me-” 

 “**HE ACTS LIKE HE WORKS HERE!**” The woman started pointing at me. “**HE DOESN'T WORK HERE! EMPLOYEES SHOULD HELP THE CUSTOMERS. HE DOESN'T WORK HERE!**” 

 I tried to ignore the lady and inspected my hand. It was painful but no serious damage. 

 “No, he doesn't work here,” the manager said calmly. 

 “**HE FOLLOWED ME THROUGH THE STORE AND PRETENDED TO WORK HERE!**” 

 “That's not true,” the elderly gentleman spoke up. “He offered to help her. He explained that he doesn't work here after she asked him.” 

 “He kept trying to give me the wrong ketchup.” To everyone's relief, the woman was now speaking at her 'normal' volume. 

 The man with the cane continued, “That man was being as helpful as he could. She wasn't being reasonable.” 

 The manager saw me looking at my hand, “are you hurt?” 

 “I'll be fine,” I replied, “I'm sorry for the mess.” 

 One of the other employees stepped close to the manager and spoke in a low voice, “that woman threw the bottle at him. We all saw it.” 

 “That's true,” the old man added. 

 “Take him and his stuff to to customer service and wait for me,” the manager told the employee. “If he needs anything for his hand, get it for him.” 

 The employee took hold of my cart and asked me to follow him. As I left the isle, the woman asked, “Are you kicking him out?” 

 “No”, the manager replied. 

 At the customer service desk up front, I asked for ice for my hand and the employees promptly provided it. 

 The customer service clerk asked us what happened. 

 “I don't know,” I started to explain, “I just-” 

 “**HE SHOULD BE KICKED OUT FOR PRETENDING TO WORK HERE!**” The loud, shrill voice could be heard through the store. 

 A moment later, the elderly man with the can walked up to the front of the store and sat on a bench near the customer service desk. “That woman is crazy!” he said. 

 Then two cops came into the store and followed an employee to the condiments isle. 

 “I have to call my wife,” I said, “I'm supposed to get this stuff for the bake sale to her and it looks like this might take a while.” 

 “Is that the \[School Name\] bake sale?” the customer service clerk asked. 

 “Yes,” I said as I made the call. “You know it?” 

 “May daughter goes to \[School Name\].” 

 “Really? My wife is organizing the bake sale...” at this point the call connects and my wife picks up. 

 I tried to explain to her what happened and that it might take longer than expected before I'm home. However, I had to cut my call short when one of the police officers started asking me questions. 

 He asked me a few questions to get my side of the events. I told him everything, including what happened with the sugar. 

 The manager arrived at customer service while I was talking to the officer. Once he was done, she said, “we're going to issue you a gift card for the value of the items in your cart.” 

 “That isn't really necessary,” I said, “It wasn't your fault.” 

 “Are you sure?” the manager seemed disappointed. 

 The clerk spoke up, “This stuff is for the \[School Name\] bake sale. His wife is the organizer.” 

 “Well, why don't you consider it a donation, then,” the manager suggested. “Plus I think we can donate some custom baked goods from our bakery.” 

 “That would be great!” 

 “Have your wife call me as soon as possible. We'll work something out.” 

 The clerk and the employee that got ice for me rang up my items, asked if I needed anything else, and issued a giftcard for just over the amount of my total and used it to pay for the groceries. They gave me the card which had less than $5 left. 

 During that time, the cop interviewed the old man. When he was done, the old man asked, “what happened to that lady?” 

 “She's been banned from the store,” the manager said coldly and walked away with the officer. 

 We both watched as the second officer escorted the lady out of the store as the manager and first officer followed.

TL;DR

* Woman steals sugar from my cart
* Same woman tries to get an elderly customer to fetch groceries for her
* She confuses me for an employee
* She is *very* particular about her ketchup bottles

We were both wearing out coats and I wore a scarf as well. I have bright pink hair and was carrying 2 bags from other stores.

A man and his wife are walking towards to us and asks where the striped blouses are. I just look at him a bit confused and I'm like: ""sir I don't work here so you gotta ask an employee"". I raised my bags a bit to show him that I was shopping as well. Thinking well H&M employees don't particularly look like employees, so honest mistake. 

""Well where are they? I don't see them?"" He responds. I just stare at him and when I look in the corner of my eye I see a woman walking around with a keychain and a earpiece in, there were at least 3 people within a few meters working here. ""There's someone"" I point at her. He grunts and walks towards this woman. ""That young lady (points at me) didn't want to help me so maybe you will?"". That lady looks at me and goes ""well she doesn't work here but I will help you"". She continues to help him while this man's wife keeps staring at me. 

We then went to the women's section to look for a nice dress and she is there too. I just smile at her and keep browsing, thinking it's a bit weird to just leave your husband like that but okay. ""Are you gonna help me or what?"" She says. I don't really respond thinking she was talking to someone else. She walks up to me ""hello??? Are you gonna help me?"". At this point I probably looked like a super confused person. ""I just explained I don't work here"". Luckily the employee who helped her husband saw what was going on and started helping the woman. 

I know it's not extreme but wtf????

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dgo6ub/i_am_not_from_here_karren/,"I am not from here, Karren! This is a long one!

So I was 16 at the time I met the Karren. I am from down south and I have the accent. I ride horses and go to competitions, so I am in Illinois. The place was a small town with one main grocery store it seemed. The show was pretty big and I could drive and I brought my close friend since I was just picking something up quickly for lunchtime and getting waters or something like that since we ran out (My barn tends to feed many of the neighbors at the show). So I go in the store alone. 
I am very sweaty since I had been moving hay bales and what not around and wearing a solid grey t shirt, plain baseball cap, belt, jeans, and cowboy boots with spurs the jingly kind (they were not big but made noise). The stores uniform was guess what, a BUTTON DOWN t shirt that was grey with the gold name plate. I was wondering around kinda clueless as to where I could find drinks so I just walked down the aisle quickly. Then she appeared in front of me.

“Oh finally a god damn employee!” -K (For Karren)

I turn around to look behind me and I see a cashier and think nothing of it and continue on my business. Now as a good polite southern bell, I dipped my hat to her acknowledging her existence as I walk around her after seeing I am not at the drinks.

K-“Where the hell do you think you’re going!?” I was startled by being shouted at for no reason.

Me-“I am sorry ma’am, I think you have the wrong person-” 
my accent must’ve been obvious for her to know I am not a local.

K-“Oh since you are a no good stupid southern hick that just moved here and started working a minimum wage job to pay for sweet tea since your brain is so watered down by incest-”

At that point I am slack jawed. If you don’t know southerns can be very well mannered and polite, but if you insult them you have been marked for death. 

Me- “I will say this once ma’am, I do not work here. I am quite bellicose with you at the moment so I shall leave before things escalate.” 

K-“What the fuck made up word did you say?”

I turned to walk away and then she grabs my wrist to pull me around. Now working with animals that are easily five times your weight means you get ripped. I yanked my wrist free and pulled my shoulders back and standing straight and taller then her.

Me-“Go the fuck on lady. I am giving you a warning don’t push it or I will chuck you like a sack of feed.” 

I left to get the drinks and I thought she got the message. My friend (Call him C) who was a year and a half younger but I only came to his shoulder height and was a big time wrestler and football player and horse rider so he was pure muscle, he came in because I was taking so long and we were in check out.

K-“There she is! That no good stupid bitch!” 

She pointed at me and you could see the confusion on the managements face.

I went ape shit, “WHO THE GOD DAMN HELL THINKS JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS A SOUTHERN ACCENT IS STUPID!? I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW YOU INSUFFERABLE HUMAN BEING, I AM A STRAIGHT A STUDENT WITH AP CLASSES AND A MEMBER OF REPRESENTATIVE FOR MY SCHOOL IN MY STATE! YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO COME HERE AND DEMAND-” 

C set his hand on my shoulder to get me to simmer down.

C-“What seems to be the problem?” 

M(Management)- “I think there has been a mistake,”

K-“NO! She assaulted me and threatened me!”

Me- “Sir, I only pulled my arm away from HER grasp and I did threaten her after she came after me!”

M- “Okay one moment I will check security footage and we will settle this.”

So we all go to the backroom and while M is checking the footage K starts to insult me once more, saying things along of I will show you dumb slut, I am very upset and C is struggling to stay quiet I can see it in his face. 

Finally K says probably when your mother was getting knocked up by her brother he fucked her so hard he knocked a few screws loose in your head. 

C bust open the door of the room with M, “PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, GET HER OUT OF HERE!” 

He grabbed K and slung her in with M

C- “I’LL WHOOP HER ASS IF I HEAR ONE MORE SHITTY THING ABOUT MY GIRL!”

I was surprised at that statement and that was the best thing about the trip.

M- “O-Okay! I am so sorry but I owe you an apology!”

K- “Thank you!”

M- “Not you.”

Me- “I just want to get the drinks and get back to my horse please.”

M- “You can have it half price I am so sorry for this inconvenience.”

Me- “Not at all sir!” I happily went on my merry way with my drinks and friend while K was screaming at the manager about everything."

I usually wear a regular Patagonia winter coat even when I would go out to fancy places or clubs because I  had a long walk home and hate freezing. 

One night my friend and I were at a club/bar that had Valet. I am coming out of the place and lost my friend for a min so I am standing outside by myself. Up walks 3 girls all a little drunk.

Me = Me, DG1 = Drunk Girl , DG2 = Drunk Girl 2, DG3 = Drunk girl 3

DG1= hand me a peice of paper

Me "" whats this?""

DG1 looks at me weird ""I need my car""

Me not understanding what is going one ""Oh, where did you park it""

DG1 ""What? get my car""

DG2 ""Come on, it is freezing out here get our car""

Me ""You want me to get  your car? I have no idea where your car is and I have drank way to much to be driving anways""

DG1 getting upset ""GET MYYY CARRRRRR""

DG2 and DG3 yelling something about the car

Me ""what in the world are you talking about? why would I get your car?""

Out walks my friend and around the same time a valet shows up.

DG1 ""hey he wont get my car. Is someone going to get it""

Valet guy looks confused because he is wearing a uniform that looks nothing like my outfit. Ask her for the ticket. But I forget I have the ticket still ( I remember this the next day when I find it in my pocket). I leave because why would I say around and listen. I finally piece together she thinks im the valet because I have a regular coat on and a black wool hat. As leavings I can hear here arguing with the valet. I am assuming it was about no having a ticket and her being to drunk to explain that. 

Maybe I did everyone a favor because these girls were way to drunk to drive. Or maybe they ended up getting their car without the valet ticket."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dgb6g4/white_ladies_mistakes_my_asian_dad_as_a_worker/,"White ladies mistakes my Asian dad as a worker. Gets seated anyways Controversial!!! 

Short story. So my family is Asian. We are KOREAN. One night, we decide to go to a JAPANESE restaurant. We get there and get seated. My dad ends up forgetting his reading glasses, so he gets up and heads to the door. As he gets there, two white soccer moms/Karens come in. They say “Hi! It’s not that busy is it?” Now my dad knows what’s up. So he grabs menus from the tiny counter and walks them OUTSIDE and seats them and tells them, “Your server will be with you in just a moment.” My dad just leaves them after that and goes to his car to get his glasses. He comes back inside and sits down with us. After about 10- 15 minutes they come back inside all mad. They notice us and my dad sitting at a table enjoying our meals. They get furious and we all start bursting out laughing. Which I think got them so embarrassed that they stormed out the restaurant. 10/10 my best night ever. Next time though, I would just parented to take their order and stuff. Thanks for reading!

Edit: To clear some stuff up...

1) the lady said “hi” and tried to make conversation by basically saying(rewording it) “it’s not busy huh” in that kinda tone. She wasn’t asking a question. It was greeting!!! Why don’t you guys understand, you guys keep thinking that they were simply asking a question. They weren’t. Do you or your family greet your servers? 

2) it may seem like a simple mistake, but automatically assuming my Asian dad, who’s not even in a uniform, is a worker is very ignorant.

3) but I understand that my dad might have taken it too far. Maybe instead he could of just said something instead of taking them outside.

4) You guys don’t have to get mad over this story. It’s something to laugh about not get mad. You guys are calling us assholes? Then why do you guys point these stupid things out? Just enjoy the story and move on. You guys are being the assholes writing essays on how we were in the wrong. I get it, just don’t all attack me because you guys are offended."

The Cubs shirts being mostly Blue and Hawks shirts being mostly Red. I typically wear one of these shorts under a polo or a button-up with khakis, then after work, I tend to take the overshirt off, leaving just the Tshirt and khakis

Every time I go into Menards or Target I get asked for help, and usually, I am more than willing to help because I know both of those stores extremely well, however, recently I was at a Target that I had never been in, buying cans of corn (if you're from the midwest, you understand), and this lady, we'll call her K for Karen, is attempting to get my attention, but I was squatting down and engrossed in my Corn Shopping (again iykyk), anyway, K walks up next to me and stomps her foot, prompting me to look up. K then proceeds to say ""Excuse me, I can't believe you were ignoring me, I am a customer! Now tell me where the Jelly is."" At this point, I stood up and said ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, This is the first time I've ever been in this store, I do not work here."" At this point K looks at my shirt and realizes her mistake, she says in a slow and ashamed voice. ""Oh, you are just wearing red... you don't work here..."" Almost immediately after, a stocker walks into the aisle and Karen pulled the same stuff with him. ""You, where is the jelly?! I'm in a hurry"" The jelly was literally behind her the entire time...

Menard's is another one that is always fun when I accidentally wear a Cubs shirt.

One time I was loading bags of mulch into my 4Runner and a lady demanded that I help her load her cart, Usually, when someone is demanding like that, I would say ""I'm sorry, I do not work here"" but when I turned around, the lady's face went stone cold, and immediately started apologizing, she was an elderly woman, so I decided I would help her out any way, she ended up giving me $5 for my troubles.

The strangest place I have had people think I worked was IKEA, I was wearing a light blue Polo after work with khakis, I made the mistake not to take my work ID badge off before I got out of my car (ID badge is only used to get into the buildings, so I typically have it with the white side facing out clipped on a belt loop, because my ID picture is horrible).         
I had 3 different people ask me for help, they were all good sports about it when I told them I did not work there... But IKEA uniforms are yellow and blue verticle striped shirts... Not a hard shirt to mix up..."

The school community itself was only three years old and taught in porta cabins as their actual school building was still being built. It’s only recently been built and last Monday was the students first day in their new classrooms. My mum was super excited to finally have her own classroom so I offered to help her decorate her room which she agreed on.

I was unpacking a boxes from the boot of the car onto a pull along trolly type of thing when my mum calls out to let me know that she was going to help a coworker carry boxes to their classroom and won’t be a minute. Okay, that’s fine. I lean against the car and browse Instagram until I hear a distant “Excuse me!” Accompanied by the sound of heels. I’m approached by a tall, thin woman with sharp features and a lanyard bouncing around her neck. Let’s call her Helen.

Helen: “what are you doing here? You’re not supposed to be on this site until Monday.”
Me: “Uhm..I’m helping my mum decorate her room?”
Helen: “No, what are you doing AT SCHOOL?” She said this slowly and with a concerned stare.

Helen nods slowly and not a second later my mum comes back and puts her arm around my shoulders.
Mum: “Hi Helen, this is my daughter skatinginfiguresof8; She’s been helping me out today, haven’t you? Honey, this is Helen, the headteacher.”
Helen just looks at me and introduces herself to which I respond “Hello, nice to meet you.”

I've always been a keen animal person, I learnt to read from basic animal fact books, and I'm full of weird and wonderful facts about Australia's wildlife. This definitely extends into the marine world too. You might be able to see where this is going...

Since my new friends are from the distance land of America, I take the opportunity to share my Aussie ocean wisdom with them as we walk through the aquarium.

I always wear a cap that says ""Living Reef Ranger"" on it, so I don't blame the people for what happened next at all, in fact, I think it's a bit funny and I'm actually proud of myself. 

As I'm explaining the social interactions of clownfish to my friends, I notice a mum with a couple young (8-12?) kids with her listening to what I'm saying. I ignore her and keep talking on with my mates. But then one of the kids asks me a question about it. I happily explain since everyone should know about nature. As kids do, he asks a few follow up questions, and I explain in simple manner so they can understand. He politely thanks me and goes back to his mum. My mates and I think it's a bit cute, but we sorta brush it off and move onto the next section. 

But the family follows. And not only them. A couple others too. I am now giving a tour of this aquarium. And I am loving it. I get to completely nerd out with my animal facts. I feel so smart. I have the power. 

....Until a youngish teen girl (15?) asks me how to get a job at the aquarium because she wants to be a marine biologist. I inform her (and hence the other people around me) that I don't actually know because I don't work here. A few surprised looks, and a few people leave my ""tour"". But I happily carried on. 

When we finished up, my friends thought it was hilarious people thought I was giving a tour, but said they felt privileged since it was free and they were the ""VIPs""."

We would have customers bring us boards to rebuild all the time. Public interest for the items we fixed went down mainly because they were not needed and very expensive. The company went under over night all the tools parts were left in the building. 

Almost a year later a buddy of mine says he bought the contents of a building site unseen and asked me to come take a look because he recognized some of the equipment being similar to what i have in my home shop. I end up riding with him no clue where we are going and end up at my old work place. 

We are there for about an hour looking through everything checking what current market values are and just looking at what all was there its been almost a year. We are about to call it a day when someone knocks at the door oops I forgot the open sign is hard wired into the lights. My buddy goes to the door and I recognize the guy he was a regular has about 20 high end whine coolers in his basement and would bring us crates full of boards to rebuild so he had spares to swap out if one ever failed and they fail frequently.  
O: old customer b: buddy m: me

O: thank god you back in business i have 2 coolers down and no spares I lost a lot of my collection. 

B: what. 

M: hes a wine collector he has massive whine coolers in his basement the board burn up constantly. he was a frequent customer. 

O: great its the same tech the other place i have been going to has an idiot for a tech. 

B: sorry dude this place has been closed a wile we don’t work here i just bought the contents 

O: what do you mean? He works here i know he does i have come here for years. The price was always $100 a board im willing to pay more if parts are more expensive. 

B: dude i have no clue what you talking about. We are not a business i just bought a bunch of random shit at auction.

I can hear wars going on i can see in the guys truck there are 2 crates of boards probably 15 all together. I pull my buddy aside. 

M: we have the parts to rebuild whats in his truck each one will take me about 5 minutes its up to you but it could be some quick cash if you got the time. 

B: ok 

I go out tell the guy i will do it for the stand price this time but the business is closed if he needs any fixed in the future i can do it out of my house but the price may change. The guy got super excited agreed left the boards his number and went to eat until we called him back. 

About an hour and a half go by i have all the boards done it was 16 of them i call the guy he shows up. 

O: how did it go all good?

M: yep they all test properly on the bench. As always you will want to test as many as you can in a machine asap.  i put my contact info in one of the crates. Total comes to $1600. 

O: no no that price won’t work you guys went out of your way to do this and you got it done in the same day thats never happened before. 

He hands my buddy a bank bag. My buddy rifles through the stack of bills inside. While i load the truck. I know the guy is a big tipper he once paid me $200 just to stay an extra half hour to pick up his stuff. 

B: there’s $2600 in here. Im the only person that bid on this crap I only paid $1200. You already made back my money and then some. 

Needless to say my shop got a bit of an upgrade that day and my wallet got a tad bit heavier too."

Anyway I was there shopping around for a TV.  I remember enjoying myself cause there was a significant absence of staff so I was not constantly bothered by people trying to help me.  Anyway Some little old man asks me for help on tv, I tell him sorry I don't work here, and the poor guy visibly deflates.

This is when HD TVs were still fairly new and there we a million different options and types, old CRTs, LED, Plasma, Thin Projection it was confusing as hell for me who had done research and shopped around.  For this poor guy it must have been a damned nightmare.  Anyway I figure I will help this poor guy out a little cause even if he finds a salesperson they are only gonna recommend whatever is most expensive anyway. 

I don't work here, but I have been doing quite a bit of TV shopping and have good feelings about this one, and maybe that one over there.  The little old man was clearly happy and wandered off to find someone to help him with his purchase."

Well, apparently I was in the one so much, that almost every time I went in, someone would approach me, asking if I knew where something would be.  Understand that the store had very little space, but did a lot of business, so things were usually crammed on the shelves.

Of course, I knew where everything was being in there so much, so I didn't mind directing people to the right aisle.

There was one older woman I had helped out a few different times, and apparently didn't realize I wasn't an employee.  After I had spent a few minutes looking to find some canned thing, she told me I deserved a raise, because none of the other employees were ever so nice or helpful.

I laughed until I realized she was serious.  Then I had to explain that I had never worked in the store, I just shopped there a lot.  

Her response, ""Well, they ought to hire you and get rid of the rest."" I'm still not sure she wasn't at least a bit serious."

I have been following this sub for months now and thought I would share my own story. First off let me start by saying that I apologize. I'm on mobile dun dun DUUUUN!!! (all jokes aside.) Let's start with some backstory.  This happened 6 days ago.

I  am a 6' 3"" male a little on the cubby side (350lb but I do not look it.) I work at a place that is a sister company that rhymes with ""Tall blart"".  We wear very similar colored vests but as you might have guested with different logos. I was also wearing black shorts a silver hat with a nice dark dark blue polo shirt. 

For this story me=me wk=wicked karen of the west  M= Manager E= employee 

One fateful  night as I'm just getting off of work about 9:30pm. My girlfriend calls me to tell me that we are out of milk and some other Misc. Items. But I only remember leaving with the milk lol. As I pull into a parking spot and get out of my vehicle I heard a faint ""excuse me sir?"" Not thinking it was pointed in my direction I thought nothing of it. (Mistake#1) half way towards the entrance door I realized that I didn't take off my vest from work.(Mistake #2) so I quickly turn around and put the vest in my truck, this time hearing a more noticeable more agitated ""Excuse me sir!?"" Once again I thought nothing of it (Mistake #3) and entered the store. Fast forward about ten minutes with the milk in my hand standing by the flower wall trying to decide on buying my girlfriend some roses or not before I head out. (I would do anything for that woman) I feel a sharp pain in my side and left leg. Cue WK. I stumbled sideways and almost fell over. Someone rammed me with their cart intentionally. I turned to the person, pissed at this moment ( real quick I am a very non confrontational person and try to aviod any sort of confrontation if possible) and yell ""WHAT THE F×$&!"" But before I could say another word she like most Karens do cut me off. 

WARNING lot of cursing ahead. Do to the rules I will dumb down the curse words

This lady had the trademark Karen hairdo long acrylic nails a designer purse looked to be in her mid to late fourtys and looked to be about 5'5""

Wk -"" I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW INCREDIBLY DISRESPECTFUL AND RUDE YOU ARE!! I. AM. A. PAYING. CUSTOMER!! I CALLED FOR YOU TO COME HELP ME IN THE PARKING LOT AND YOU AS A EMPLOYEE IGNORED ME!! DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM?! I WILL HAVE YOUR JOB FOR THIS!! COME WITH ME YOU PIECE OF CRAP(other word) WE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH YOUR MANAGER!!
she then went to grab my arm to try to drag me to the nearest Manager (watching a 5'5 woman try to drag a 6'3 full grown man like he's a little kid will always make me laugh (but like I said I.was.Pissed.) ) 
I snatched my arm away from her and yelled back

Me-  ""LADY I DON'T GIVE A FLYING RAT FRICK WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE AND HONESTLY I DON'T WANT TO KNOW! I DO NOT WORK HERE! ALSO WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO PHYSICALLY ASSAULT SOMEONE WHEN YOU DONT GET WHAT YOU WANT YOU ENTITLED WITCH!"" 
 upon hearing the yelling, I heard some running footsteps and around a corner popped out  employee.

E-"" What's going on here? ""

WK- Insert smug smile here* THIS EMPLOYEE IGNORED ME AND PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED ME WHEN I TRIED TO ASK FOR SOME HELP! I DEMAND TO SPEAK WITH YOUR MANAGER ABOUT GETTING THIS MAN FIRED!!

WK-insert Banshee scream here* YOU SON OF A WITCH DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?! I WILL PERSONALLY MAKE SURE YOU NEVER WORK IN THIS TOWN AGAIN!

Me- lady I thought I already summarized that I do not flippin care who the hell you are nor do I want to. Your lucky that I haven't already called the police for assault on you.

At this moment PE and M come running around the corner. 

M- what seems to be the problem here? 

WK- I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS WHEN YOU'RE EMPLOYEE ASSAULTED ME AND STARTED YELLING AND BERATING ME I WANT THIS MAN FIRED!!

Me- sir she is spreading lies and twisting her story around she is the one that assaulted me I lifted my shirt to show the marks that was left by her cart on my side and left calf(calf had a good bruise) 

WK- EWWW NO ONE WANTS TO SEE YOUR FAT A$% BODY PUT IT AWAY NOW! OMG WHO WOULD LOVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT (yes this witch resorted to fat shaming me. She went there.) 

 I will be proud of what I said next till the day I die. (once again I have no idea who this woman is. Or if she has a daughter or not but what I said shut her up.)

Me- That's not what your Daughter said last night. 

E- OHHH
M to E- stop it
M to me- Sir I'm going to have to ask you to stop right there before I escort you out of the building

ME- sorry I understand 

M to WK- mam I can assure you that this man does not work for tall Blart

WK- JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I WILL BE CONTACTING YOUR CORPORATE OFFICE TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THIS RUDE EMPLOYEE THAT YOU ARE DEFENDING AND WHAT A INCOMPETENT MANAGER YOU ARE!!

M- Please leave the store mam.

WK scoffs*  stomps out of the store.

M to ME- Sir I do apologize for any convenience this must have caused you, would you like us to call the police so you can file a report against her? 

Tbh I seriously did consider pressing charges on her for assault. I was tired and wanted to go home. That and I didn't want to go through the whole court process. So I let it go. Paid for my milk and went home.

That wasn't my first karen encounter and unfortunately probably won't be the last either 
I sincerely hope that I never run into that woman again.  Thank you for reading.

(Also the part about the bruise on my leg was more of a mark from where the cart hit me bruise didnt show till later.)

           UPDATE UPDATE!!!!  10/16/19
So I never thought That I would've run into WK again so soon, but I did two days ago.

Lets begin.  For part 2 the cast is ME= yours truly WK= wild karen M= Manager  P1=cop 1 P2=cop 2 S=Supervisor 

It was about 2pm and I was having a O.K day but that quickly changed when I got a call from my supervisor 
S- hey OP there is a upset customer looking for you.

ME- (since I deal with this stuff on a daily.) Alright send em over.
Four minutes later the door opens but I didn't hear it because I had my head in the steel pulling the merchandise forward, when all of a sudden I hear a voice that sent a shiver up my spine. 
WK- Why hello O...P at least I know your name now.
I backed out turned and to my horror there she was.
ME- Why hello again mam thank you for coming is there anything I can help you with? 

WK- No O...P (she kept saying my name slowly like she was going to forget it or something. ) but I do think that you have a mess to clean up.

ME- I'm sorry, what?
She grabbed two of the nearest bottles and slammed them onto the floor smashing them spraying alcohol everywhere 
WK- I said that you have a mess to clean up....now Clean....it.....up. like the lowly servant of society that you are!
ME-( I have had it with this B****) Mam I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.

What she did next threw my anger into overdrive and astounded me at the same time.
WK- *Slaps ME. THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT NOW CLEAN THIS MESS UP YOU SON OF A WITCH
(Her acrylic nails scratched my cheek. Cutting it a little.) 

Looking at her she had the biggest smile like she stole Christmas from the Whos. 
I WAS SO PISSED I WAS SEEING RED
ME- as I was walking to the cashier register*
No mam in my personal opinion I would have to disagree the customer isn't always right in fact 95% of the time they are wrong. 

(I have a silent Alarm button that calls law enforcement as soon as I press it.) 

Once I had reached the register I reached down and pressed the button. I stood up turned around to once again be slapped 
ME- OW seriously lady Lea-
WK- I SAID CLEAN THAT MESS UP OR I'M GOING TO GET YOUR MANAGER AND TELL THEM YOU THREW THOSE BOTTLES  AT ME YOU BASTARD! THE ONLY REASON WHY THERE IS A CUSTOMER...SERVICE...JOB IS SO UNEDUCATED PIECES OF SHITS LIKE YOU HAVE TO SERVE ME!!!!

In my mind I was ready to deck this woman ( now I believe that a man shouldn't  EVER  hit a woman.... untill the second time she's cracked you in the face. I didnt hit her though.) 

ME- peices of shit like me huh? GET OFF YOUR DUCKING HIGH HORSE LADY AND SPEW YOUR ENTITLED ATTITUDE TOWARDS SOMEONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO LICK YOUR ASSWHOLE TO PLEASE YOU! 
I looked outside to see that two cop cars had pulled up to the store 
ME over the radio to M: Hey M I have a code brown in the liquor store I'm going to need you. 
M- on the way OP

WK- WHAT DID YOU DO?! WHY ARE THERE COP CARS OUTSIDE? 

ME- Something that I should've done a week and a half ago. 

C1 and C2 enter the store followed by M

C1 whats going on here

I went to start giving my story but like all karens love to do she cut me off.

WK-THIS EMPLOYEE IS REFUSING TO SERVE ME HE TRIED TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT ME BUT I PUSHED HIM OFF  THEN HE THREW THESE BOTTLES AT ME I WANT HIM FIRED!!

ME- to C1,C2 can one of you take the screaming Banshee outside so I can give my statement in peace. 

WK- WHAT DID YOU CALL ME YOU SON OF A B****
This retarded woman had the audacity to slap me a third time in front of two police officers. 
They immediately to action and while she was kickin and screaming she knocked over four bottles of merchandise in the end she was sitting in the back of the police car. 
When the police officer came back into the store 
P1- alright sir right now we've aressted her for assault on you and assault on a police officer as well a disorderly conduct.  would You like to-

ME yes sir I would love to press charges and I am certain that my lovely Manager would love to give you the security camera recording of this whole incident. 

M nods in approval. 

   To make a longer story a little shorter I gave my statement P1 reviewed the security footage. Now two days have passed and P1 knocked on my door this morning and said that my court date would be towards the end of November.  I'll update the story again when the time comes.

 I know this story was super long but if you made it this far thanks for Reading!"

1:Older women asks where coffee machines are, I reflexively tell her ""I don't work here"" before realize I do in fact know the answer to that. Directions given I continue with my wandering.

2: Stopping in the home good clearance section I see that the sheets,curtains, etc. are a mess and I can't get pass my cart to the otherside. I stop and begin to pick up and stack stuff on the selves in a semi-neat pile. A ~30 yr old women appropriate and picks up a sheet with zero packaging or stickers.She turns and looks at me.
Lady: How much is this sheet?

Me: Oh I don't work here,heh shouldn't have wore red in a target. Second time today. If you bring it to the front they can probably find it on the app, an employee did that with me earlier.

She at this point set it down,I, being curious wanted to see if I was right. I took out my phone and typed in the brand and color name. 

Me: Oh it is on the app and was $24.99, cool

Lady: So what is it now?

Me:Uh I don't know

Lady: What do you guys price it as in clearance?

Me: I don't work here

Lady: You don't?

Me:Nope.

I walked away

Bonus: Saw 3 people standing at a scanner pole attempting to get a price on 2 things. They stopped me to ask if I knew if these near identical things were the same price. 

""I don't know, I don't work here but let me scan it on my phone"" they were the same price and these people looked at me in wonder as if my phone was magic."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dfirv8/where_is_the_f_tonic_water/,"“Where is the f****** tonic water?” A funny flashback to my days in the beer industry.

I was a level 3 of 4 in the company despite being a 24 year old and my days consisted of meetings, meetings, sales, presentations, and meetings.

Nothing was better than holidays when I chose to take off the business suit, throw on some blue jeans and a Miller Lite brand polo, and help the distributors sling beer on the shelves. 

One day I made the unfortunate decision to wear a red polo at an H-E-B (grocery store in Texas). Employees wore.... red polos.

Despite the fact that mine had a huge Miller Lite logo on it and was a different shade of red, I spent my day apologizing to customers that I didn’t know what aisle X, Y, or Z was on.

Then came the Karen in all her Karen glory.

I feel someone grab and yank my polo as I’m throwing a 24 pack into the cooler.

“Where the FUCK is the tonic water? There is no fucking tonic water! I need my damn tonic water. What is wrong with you people?....”

It went on for probably 45 seconds when I held my hand up to her face and said “We don’t work here!” 

Karen turned red, all flustered, and started sputtering and apologizing. “I thought you were an employee.”

As she walked away I told my distributor, LOUDLY, “Wow, what kind of miserable person speaks to Anyone like that???” 

Not a great comeback but I bet Karen thought twice before verbally assaulting an employee again."

A few stories, they’re short, but they bring me and my friends and family a laugh every so often. 

Cast: 
Me
M (mom)
D (dad) 
RL (random lady)
W (worker)
P (photographer) 

This takes place at Universal Studios, bright and early, in the Harry Potter Wizarding World area. 

So, I love Harry Potter, I’ve read all the books- read the first one five times if I recall, and the third one in a week in third grade- but that’s a story not for this reddit. 

Anyways, since I love Harry Potter, and my mom had bought me some Ravenclaw (my Hogwarts house) clothes for a Luna Lovegood Halloween costume, she thought it might be super fun to do a photo shoot in the park, just for fun and for a few other reasons. My grandpa had just died recently, and we were all very sad because of this. So- my mom bought a wonderful sign saying something along these lines- “those that love us never truly leave us” for me to hold in the shoot. 

Some very important details- at the time I was a teenager, around 13-14 years old. We had paid a woman my mom knew to do my makeup, which meant that at four am, my hair and make up were done and I was dressed in my costume, ready to get to the park. I looked a lot older than I really was, the makeup was amazing and I was so excited for this! We got to the park early, but not totally people free, which was fine because we didn’t mind the amount of people, it just meant we had to be careful with pictures and that we weren’t disturbing guests. We ourselves were guests at the park and could be there, but it would be rude to try and take advantage of that unfairly and all. 

Scene one- I’m famous. 

So, with the camera and the photo taking and the entire “around 20 year old” look I had, people were taking pictures. Of me. Getting my picture taken. 

Me: Mom, why is everyone looking at me so much? 

M: I think they think you’re a famous celebrity or something, or you’re important cause you’re having your photos taken. 

Me: oh. Oh wow that’s funny- 

Because I was not famous, no, my mother is a goddess and makes friends and is very nice and amazing, so she planned this all very well. I finish my picture in the area, and we move on. I start to notice that yes, people are looking at me because I look rather authentic- my outfit looks like what the actual workers are wearing and I look a lot older, so it’s no surprise this happens (and yes, here is where the RL comes in) 

Scene 2- We decide to ask if I can have my picture taken in one of the rides waiting lines. That meant we would get in, take pictures, and leave, not ride the ride itself and cut a bunch of people. This is because at most rides in the Harry Potter area- the inside decoration is great and very detailed. So of course I’d fit right in with my outfit and wand. 

P: Okay, we’d like to try and take pictures here, is that okay? 

W: sure! I’ll lead the way, as long as you don’t disturb anyone or cut the line, that’s fine. 

My mom, dad, the photographer, and me all go to follow the worker, when I get stopped by someone. The area before the ride to put your bags and stuff is very hectic, I’ve been on the ride the day before and knew the rules for the bags and loose items already, as well as how crazy this place can be. 

RL: excuse me? Can I bring this bag on the ride? *gestures to her purse* 

Me: um... i don’t-

My group is getting farther away and I’m scared to lose them, so I skip the mess and just say: 

Me: You can’t bring any purses on this ride, you’ll have to put them in a cubby miss. *i point at a sign on the wall that has a “no bags” allowed picture on it* I’m sorry, but I have to go now. 

I walk off quickly and join my group, wondering what the heck just happened. I told my mom and dad, and then realized that she must have thought I worked there, since I looked like I was in my 20s with the makeup, my outfit was very close to the workers (actually, I looked eerily similar to most workers-) and that the place was dark, anything that said I was a teen was unseeable in this little room. So we all had a laugh, and later in the room I got a lot of stares for the picture taking and got very flustered (I’m not good with open staring if I know it’s happening and whoever is staring is close or i can’t see them- which is a little odd since I’m doing this photo shoot- but whatever. I knew the people doing my pictures better so I didn’t mind them, it was their job after all lmao) 

And that’s it! 

TLDR: I’m at universal studios to do a photo shoot dresses like a Ravenclaw student, a woman mistakes me for a 20 year old worker (I was 13) and I helped her despite not actually working at the park! 

Overall fun and simple despite my rambling description of what the heck everything was, and the pictures from that area were really fun to shoot! This story really is fun to talk about when I tell friends and guests about the shoot if they ask, because I’m a little known for being assumed older, and the more it happens, the better it gets really lmao."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dfcmky/its_a_costume_no_really/,"It’s a costume. No, really! My office had a Halloween themed sales event today where everyone had to come in costume. 

Since I don’t usually otherwise dress up for Halloween and didn’t want to burn money on a single use costume I asked a mechanic friend if I could borrow one of his jumpsuits from work and he obliged. 

This was good both because it was a free costume and because it had a comedic element. 

Anyone who works with me knows I have a medical condition that disqualifies me from driving, so have never owned a car, let alone worried about car maintenance. 

So I was at the bus stop on the side of the road  in my costume when a frantic woman runs up to me. 

FW: Frantic woman


FW: Sir, excuse me, my car broke down and I have no idea what’s wrong. I’m headed into work and really can’t wait for a tow, would you mind taking a look?


Me: Oh, haha. Sorry, this is actually just a costume. 


FW: Do I look like I was born yesterday? 


Me: No, really, I’m headed to a Halloween thing. 


FW: At 8am on a Monday? Look, if you don’t want to help me, be man enough to say so. Don’t go making up a wild story. 


Me: I can’t help you. I don’t even drive. I’ve never owned a car. I’d help if I could. 


FW: A mechanic who’s never owned a car? Why are you jerking me around? 


Me: I am not a mechanic. This is a costume. 


FW: I’ve got a baby in there! You’re going to let a baby sit in a hot car because you’re too lazy to take a quick peek under my hood? 


Me: Thought you said you were going to work? 


FW: That is besides the point! Are you going to help me or no? 


Me: I can’t, I’m not a mechanic. 


FW: I’M NOT STUPID. 


Me: I didn’t say you were stupid. I said I’m not a mechanic. 


FW: I’m going to call your boss and tell him all about this. You better believe I’m posting it on Yelp, too. 


Me: You don’t think it’s the least bit strange that a car mechanic is here at a bus stop? 


FW: Turn around! Let me see where you work! 


(My buddy’s company logo is on the back of the suit and his name is embroidered on the front.)


Me: Whatever, fine.

I'm wearing a slit up the side black cocktail dress, fuscia bolero, fancy evening-out heels and hairdo, dangly sparkly glittery earrings, *carrying a little leather clutch ffs.* All dolled up for a fancy night out. 

This is a fairly rural, not especially prosperous area, so not anybody's everyday attire around here.

On the way to said fancy night out I run into our local I can't believe it's still in business department store in the county's slowly dying outdoor mall to grab a greeting card. And I need a cardigan. I have a spare minute. Ooooh. Look, pretty dresses! And pretty tops! La la la. Grab this one, ooh, and this one, that one, hmm, and this one too...

Yippee! Found the cardis. There's an older woman (OW) twenty feet away.

OW: Excuse me, where are the rest rooms?

Me (rifling through the  cardigans): The ladies' is to the right of the customer service desk - where that lady is standing (point) - the desk is directly in front of her. Go to where she is, go to the desk, then go to the right. (I'm 53. Through middle aged necessity I now know the location of most public toilets in town.)

OW: Oh. Thank you. I'm looking for my husband.

Me (find my cardigan, turn, give a little wave): Well, good luck with that (no snark, slight befuddlement while teetering across the store to the fitting rooms balancing hangers, folded things, purse). 

Try everything on. Return rack all save my beautiful new sweater. Which, come to think of it, is a tad too big. So back I go. To the cardis. OW is just where I left her. And happy day, with her husband.

Me: Oh good! You've found him.

Husband (chuckling): Looks like it. 

OW: Yes. Do you carry xyz brand?

Me (sort of giving myself a once over, laughing): I don't know. I'm just shopping (flit fingers as imaginary fairy dust twinkles to the floor). I don't work here.

OW (taking in amused me and my get-up): Oh. Of course. You had so many hangers with you before I though you did.

TL:DL If you're holding several hangers of merchandise, you work there, dangly sparkly glittery earrings be dammed.

Self awareness lesson: I shop too much. I got a pretty cardigan. But forgot to get the card. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

I walked into my usual bar and ordered my usual cocktail. The bartender poured it a bit high on top of a little too much ice, and gave me a stack of napkins I would inevitably need as I made my way to the patio.

I get out to the patio and immediately at one of the tables with less light (therefore easier to not notice a dark bottle), someone accidentally knocks a beer over and drenches their friend. I chuckled and said, ""hey, I just happen to have these napkins if you need them. Take 'em all!""

I begin to walk away and I hear, ""Thanks, and sorry, will you bring me a new Bud light?"" I didn't think he was talking to me so I made my way to my usual spot and then I overhear, ""I don't think he works here."" I realized the confusion and clarified my non-employment status at this establishment and we all had a nice laugh.

TL;DR: bartender made my cocktail to the brim by mistake, gave me napkins to compensate, I gave them away and was mistaken for a bartender by some nice people"

My husband and I had gone to the blue megastore to look around for some gifts for our nieces and nephews. We had our kids with us, so we decided to split up. He would take our kids over to play with/look at the PJ Masks toys while I scoured the arts and crafts aisle for my niece.

I'm dressed fairly casually, though I can see why this guy mistook me. I was wearing khaki pants, a black undershirt, and a short-sleeve bright blue shirt that had Toothless wrapped up in faerie lights on the front of it. I was also sporting a Santa hat that said, ""Merry Christmas"" on it. The store's uniform has casual pants and bright blue vests, and since this guy approached me from behind, it's understandable.

As I'm looking at the craft sets, I hear some guy (SG) behind me go, ""Hey, Santa!""

I'd forgotten I was wearing the hat, so I didn't look around, but picked up the box I was considering to see what was included.

SG: ""Um, excuse me? Santa?""

Confused now, I looked around and spotted SG, who was in his mid-forties and staring right at me.

SG: ""Hi, sorry, I was wondering if you could tell me where the Paw Patrol toys are.""

I turn fully to face him. ""Oh, sure, they're just...""

SG has taken a couple seconds to look at my shirt, my pentagram necklace, and interrupts me. SG: ""Oh, you don't work here, do you?""

I laugh a little. ""No, I don't, but I know where the Paw Patrol stuff is. My kids are playing over there."" Having decided against the craft box, I put it back. ""Here, I'll show you."" 

We made some small talk as I walked him over and collected my kids and husband so we could move on. We wished each other a Happy Christmas and parted ways."

Like someone's name is Bryan Jones, we can type ""Br"" and the system says Brian Smith, typing a ""y"" can complete to Bryan Connor.

So this happened last year on my third shift at my new job. I work at a pizza chain (Domino’s), that’s located just outside of a supermarket, I migrated to Australia about 6 years ago and had became an Australian citizen before I got the job. Mind you, I had a slight American accent but I can easily switch to my Malaysian accent pretty quickly. 

Me: as myself.  EK: Entitled Karen.   MB: my brother (manager) 

My manager had sent me out of the store to go pick up some stuff at the local shop as we were running out of a few certain toppings, I sped walked down every aisle to search for the items, checking my phone because it was nearing til the end of my shift whilst also glancing at cash out area, I finally found the item I searched for looked for which ones that are the cheapest in big quantities when a wild Karen appeared, she started ranting to me about some stuff in another aisle, note: My uniform is full black, black dress pants, a black belt, black leather shoes, a hairnet, a black hat with the Domino’s logo, and infamous black polo top with Dominos’ written on the back. It was clear to any sane customer that I was a Domino’s worker while as the workers at the local shop wore, white blouse button ups, black dress pants, hair tied back, and a badge showing that they worked at that local shop. To make it even more of a difference, I was still wearing the apron from Domino’s. (The hat I had to wear also had the logo on it.)

I remember the conversation going like this; also note that this was during my first week at the job. 

EK: What are you doing on your phone?!

Me (I switched to my Malaysian accent): Sorry what?

EK: So unprofessional! I have been trying to get your attention for the past 5 minutes!

Me: I don’t work he-

EK: don’t give that bullshit! I want these following items! Make it quick! 

She pushed her shopping list into my already full hands of large packets of oregano and chicken salt. 

Me: Ma’am I don’t work here! I work at-

EK: Stop making dumb excuses right now! Do your damn job! 

At this point, I checked my phone and I was well over overtime. While the wild Karen was busy ranting I ran to the cash out and paid for the items. Than as quick as my tired legs can, I ran back to the store I work for. Gave the change and receipt to my manager who’s also my brother. Told him the whole situation on why I was taking 30 minutes to buy oregano and chicken salt. He said I can clock out now, and take some spare garlic breads home. While I was in the midst of taking my apron, the door opened, mind you our door didn’t have a bell on top but it did slammed pretty damned loud shut. 

Standing at the front was the entitled Karen from the shops, she looked fuming red. My brother handed me a couple pizzas that were to be picked up, I yelled the name no reply. So I placed it back on the hot shelf. I turned to EK and put on my most fakest customer service smile and voice and spoke, 

Me: Hello, welcome to Domino’s! How can I help you today? (In an American accent) 

EK: You?! 

Me: Yes? How can I HELP you today? 

EK: What are you doing behind there? You’re supposed to be at (insert local shop name) working there instead!

//then appears my brother speaking in his fake customer service American accent//

MB: Hello ma’am, may I ask. Why are you yelling at my fellow employee here?

EK: she..she gimme my pizza! 

MB: may I get the name than? 

EK: a pepperoni pizza now! 

Me: Have you ordered your pizza?

EK: What do you think I’m doing Rn! Ordering you IDIOT! 

MB: Ma’am I must ask you to lower your voice and not to speak to our employees like that please! 

I went on to make the order, but my brother had other plans. He told me to clock out and would pay for the overtime. Even though it was a Sunday and we do 10% surcharges on Sundays. He came home later that night and told me that he had the security to physically removed her from the property. And now I haven’t even seen that Karen at all. 

And now whenever I have a shitty day at work, and someone ask “how was work?” I reply, “oh sure, I enjoy feeding and making food for entitled Ungrateful Karens and received shouts of obscenities from drunkards for 9 hours a week. It was greattttt” I really do enjoy working there though."

This was a few years ago. Uber was already big, but not as big as it is now. 

Our nearest airport is in a major city so it’s always hectic picking somebody up. 

The cops/yellow vest traffic guys, don’t like you waiting around at all. 

So I get there and it’s taking my girlfriend a few minutes longer to get her checked bag than we anticipated. I’m on the phone with her and she says “I see it, I see it, I’ve got to go, don’t leave.” 

So the traffic vest guy is waving at me and I roll down my window and say “I’m picking somebody up, she’s just on her way” etc, trying to buy myself some time. 

I hear my trunk open and I’m so relieved. She jumps in the back and I thought it was a little weird, but she took a red eye and I figured she was just going to lie down in the back and go back to sleep. I say something along the lines of “Oh perfect timing, how was your flight” and I couldn’t hear her response. 

It was super loud with honking and cops shouting so she closes the door and I’m so focused on trying to find a spot to pull out I don’t even look back I just say “you good?” And she says “mmhmm” and as I’m pulling out I’m thinking “wait...” and as I’m driving away I look in the back and realize this woman is not my girlfriend. It’s some teenage kid. 

I’m freaking out as I’m driving away and desperately looking for a spot to pull over, but by this point I’m in the middle lane with rushing outflow of traffic, and when I finally saw a space a cop or just a traffic director, I couldn’t tell, very aggressively told me I couldn’t stop there. 



While I’m trying to pull over I’m like “who are you?!”



Her: Uhhh... Molly. 



Me: Molly, I don’t know you, what is this, what are you doing!?



Her: Were you expecting to know me? 



(I’m so confused at this point my heart is racing and it’s all I can do to not crash my car because it’s 4am and a strange kid got in my car at the airport and my first thought was I was being framed for a crime or something. I didn’t know what to think.) 



Me: Why are you in my car?!?! I’m pulling over. 



Her: Why are you pulling over??




Me: I don’t know you!! 




Her: What?! 




Me: What?? 

Her: What is going on. Is this because it’s a long trip? You can’t cancel because of where I’m going, that’s not allowed. 

(I take a few seconds to try and figure out what she’s talking about while merging into a busy highway. Then it hits me.)




Me: I AM NOT YOUR UBER. 



Her: What!!?! 




Me: I’m pulling over!



Her: You’re lying. 


Me: Why would I lie about that? Look. Look at your app. Does the driver look like me?

Me: Knew what? 


Her: YOU KNEW YOU WEREN’T MY UBER

Her: IM CALLING 911! IM CALLING 911 IF YOU DO NOT LET ME OUT. 


Me: Look we are a minute from the airport you can see the terminal, look 



(She continues sobbing.) 



We get there. I park and thank God she didn’t call the cops and I see my many missed calls and texts from my poor girlfriend. This girl BOLTS out of my car screaming 

HEELLLLPPPP, HELP, HHHELLLLPPP


Cops and guys in yellow vests, whatever they are, surround my car. 

I’m taken for questioning and it takes so long that my car is almost towed, thankfully they allowed my girlfriend to park it. 

Thankfully it created such a spectacle that my girlfriend was able to notice this happening and vouch for my being at the airport to pick her up and not pose as an Uber driver to abduct a teenage kid. And park my car. 

By the end the misunderstanding was completely sorted out and the girl had calmed down and she (and her parents over the phone) apologized and explained it was her first time traveling alone or being in a large city and she was on edge. They never came right out and admitted fault but did say they wish there hadn’t been such a misunderstanding. 

Now I can look back and laugh but at the time it was one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced and it was months until I could stop my car with the doors unlocked again.

I was making my purchase right there in electronics and while i was being rung up, I hear directly behind me, “you should be ashamed of yourself!”  I turn my head to see what was going on, thinking some sort of scene was happening behind me, but low and behold, some little dishevelled fool was standing right behind me, glaring at me.

*with what must have been a look of pure confusion
M: excuse me?

F: how can you do that?

M: *even more bewildered.. HUH?

F: do you feel proud of yourself turning on your own people like that?
Both F and i are POC

M: excuse me?

F: you think youre fooling anybody? I know youre security here!

M: *kinda chuckling in disbelief “what are you talking about? I dont work here”

F: what the (fudge) ever! Be proud of yourself then!

After finally finishing ringing me up and giving me my change..
SE: this man doesnt work here sir!

F: sure he does! Just look at him!

SE and I share an eye roll and a look of exhaustion, and just smile about it. 

SE: sorry about that sir, thank you and have a goodnight. You sir, cant bother other customers or ill have security escort you out. 

I just grabbed my bag and new purchase, smiled at the fool and walked away to find my wife. Thanks for the read

Edit to include the fact that F and i are POC

This store just opened for the day and I went to get some party supplies for a birthday party tonight. 

Walking up and down the aisle trying to find this thing and I’m barely awake and I haven’t had any coffee yet. 

Then I see a worker and go up to her and say, “Ma’am, I’m looking for—“

And she turns around and has a confused look on her face and I realize that she is not wearing yellow like all the employees are... so I continue —
“— something that you can’t help me with because you obviously don’t work here and I’m an oblivious idiot. I’m so sorry it’s early for me and I haven’t had coffee yet not that that’s an excuse and I can’t stop talking because I’m thoroughly embarrassed. And now instead is just walking away I’m wasting both of our time. Truly apologize.” 

And I walked away as fast as I could. Found an employee. Got what I need all the while trying to avoid making contact with the lady I thought was an employee.

Been sick the past couple days and listening to these stories when I remembered that I have a story of my own.

So, my mom, sis, and I all wanted to go to the craft store and me being me, I just threw on whatever clothes I could find. A pair of shorts and a blue Vault-Tec shirt with yellowish on the left side and a large Vault-Tec/Vault Boy on the back.

We went to Jo-Anns first and nothing happened, then we went to Hobby Lobby... and this is where our story takes place.

Now I didn't relize what I was wearing and how similar it was to the employees. Only difference is, they had on khaki pants, a more thicker shirt with a collar and orange print on the left side with the name, and dress-type shoes. (I was in flip flops.)

I was browsing the aisles and making my way to the next one when a lady from the other aisle approached me.

Lady: Do you have this kind of fabric pain in this color?

Her question was a lot longer, but that's the basics of it. I didn't interrupt her because that's rude and she was talking too much to fast for me to say anything.

Me: Um, I don't work here. (I said very akwardly because this was kinda and akward situation.)

Lady: (She looked completely embarrassed for a second before she burst out laughing.) Oh, I'm so sorry, I just saw the color of your shirt and assumed you worked here. I'm sorry.

Me: Its okay, I didn't even realize I was wearing a color similar to the employees. (I was laughing with her.)

Lady: Kinda, like you dont wear blue to Walmart, right?

Me: Or red to Target.

Just then her friend came over and asked what she was doing.

Lady: Just harassing someone who doesn't work here.

We all laughed, she apologized again and we all parted ways. Although, I did leave the store quickly after that. Nothing happened, no punches thrown, or cops called. Just someone who made a mistake and we had a good laugh about it. Have a good one everyone!"

Ok, so here we go.


My brother works for a removal firm that essentially 'shells' old businesses; ie if a shop or a cafe gets shut down for whatever reason, the firm come in to remove signs and display boards, disassemble counters, that sort of thing. Yesterday he was working at what used to be a cafe in a town a few hours away from where we live. The main doors were wide open as there were many people carrying things in and out of the place (Important to note).


My brother was in what used to be the main area of the cafe, when he looked up and saw a man with an assistance cane walking in through the front door. 


My brother came up and asked him if he could help him. The guy said: ""Yes, a table for one, please.""

My brother responded: ""Oh, um... I don't work here. No-one works here anymore"" and went on to explain that the place had been shut down and he was just there to clear everything out.

The guy was upset; apparently this cafe used to be one of his favourite places, but no-one had told him it was shutting down. He didn't kick up a huge fuss or anything, he just apologised and left. 


TLDR - A blind man thought my brother worked for a cafe that doesn't exist anymore."

I’ve had numerous run ins with people thinking I work for the store I’m in because I have on a uniform. Most of them are alright, they realize their mistake apologize and move on about their day.  But not this behemoth of a woman. 
This literally just happened yesterday. So I’m doing a mandatory annual alarm inspection at a health food store, the uniforms of the normal employees are green but the managers there wear navy blue.  As luck would have it my uniform is also navy blue.  Suddenly during my inspection I feel a hand grab my shoulder and spin me around.  The wall of human flesh that grabbed me appeared to be upset about something. Come to find out the Noah’s ark shaped person before me was upset that the store was out of jackfruit (a rather pricey fruit that to my knowledge doesn’t grow in the US) and demanded that I go in the back and get her a jackfruit this instant.  I told her that I unfortunately didn’t work there and had no clue what she was talking about, she then proceeded to scream “bullshit” at the top of her lungs and grabbed me by the collar and forcibly dragged my happy ass up to the front of the store where she then tossed me on the ground in front of the senior manager and asked what the hell they were thinking hiring someone like me. The real manager had to then inform her that I was not affiliated with the store and that she had just assaulted a fire alarm inspector and that they called the police as soon as they saw her drag me across the store (they actually didn’t). Never in my life have I seen a “two ton Tina” run that fast out of a store.

To fill in the blanks here, I was parked on the street next to the liquor store and a big delivery haagen dazs delivery truck was double parked next to me. So I walked in the store to the guy in the haagen dazs uniform and he was about to tell me he didn’t work there and his finger was slightly up to point to an employee and was so surprised to see that it actually was him I needed.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/debfut/karen_wants_my_trolley/,"Karen Wants My Trolley I have quite a few IDWHL stories, most are from many years ago and the details are fuzzy. Some are more recent but don't feature a 'Karen'. This one, however, happened on Saturday afternoon and had a proper Karen-in-the-wild.

 As usual, a bit of pretext: While I have a collection of vastly differing skills, my main occupation has me on construction sites. Sites are inherently dangerous places, and every few years one finds oneself in a crumpled heap a few meters below where they were moments previously.  Such an occasion occured to me on Thursday, due to an old ladder rung going for early retirement while I was resting my entire weight on it.  Suffice to say, I gave myself a proper spannering; dislocating and hyper-extending my shoulder, giving my opposite knee a good twist and a decent bruising (to match my ego).

Friday and the first half of Saturday was spent in a drug-induced haze, with heat packs, hot baths and enough cursing to make a sailor blush.  Late Saturday my shoulder was still entirely useless, but I was starting to get mobility back into my knee, enough that I felt able to head to the local 'sheepvalue' store.  This particular store has a very limited amount of parking at ground level, but a decent amount at rooftop, with two lifts down into the front of the store. Trolleys are often in short supply in the store, so I grabbed one up at rooftop where they're in plenty, both to make sure I had one, and to act as a bit of support to my ailing knee and shoulder.  

Get into the lift, hold the door (hodor!) for a lady hurrying to make it, down we go.  As the doors open I let the lady go first due to my busted arse hobbling, and I've barely cleared the lift when a wild Karen grabs the front of my trolley and exclaims ""About time, you people should do a better job restocking trolleys!"" Her condescending expression gathering a hint of confusion about the eyes, much like stormclouds gathering when I don't immediately let go of the trolley. Now I'm not a small guy, I'm 105kg and 6'2"", heavily bearded, I'm wearing jeans, sneakers and a pale blue t-shirt with a small girl kneeling in prayer & text that says 'May they all burn in hell'. Fairly distinctly removed from the staff uniform of green vest, light gray shirt and dark gray trousers.

I'm pretty easy going, but being in pain and low on sleep means I've been getting out of the wrong side of bed two nights in a row, and I have no patience for Karen's shit. ""There are plenty up in the carpark, feel free to go fetch one."" Karen's eyes nearly bug out of her head, and she jerks on the trolley while inhaling sharply to feed me some line about her privilege no doubt, but she doesn't get the chance because her jerk on the trolley had sent a jolt of pain straight up my arm, and my knee was halfway giving out. This presented via a loud grunted ""FUCK!"" From me, followed by an angry and not particularly quiet ""Fuck's sake lady, take a look at me, and tell me what part of what you see leads you to believe I work here!""

She didn't immediately let go but just stood there, mouth agape and slack, eyes trying to find something to make sense of what I just said. I still had one good arm and one good leg, turns out that was more than enough to push free of Karen's deathgrip and hobble off.  Felt like throwing more abuse at her as I passed regarding her 'you people' comment but couldn't think of anything witty at the time.

Saw her pointing me out to a staff member when I was checking out, I pointed to a staff member nearby and mouthed 'Staff!' while nodding my head. Pointed to myself and mouthed 'Not staff!' while shaking my head. Put my bags in my trolley and hobbled back to the lifts.

May she burn in hell."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/debpjf/i_am_not_a_nurse/,"I am not a nurse. So at my job (in a long term care pharmacy) the dress code is business casual or scrubs. I don’t wear scrubs often, but I will once a month or so when I’m feeling lazy. My best friend’s wife went into labor and he called me about the news. I told him I’d head up to the hospital after work. I was wearing scrubs that day. I go in and get up to the waiting room, he comes out and gives me an update, he goes back to the room, and I go hang out in the waiting room. My scrubs, of course, were the same color the nurses at this hospital wear. I’m sitting in the waiting room and this lady approached me, very angry, yelling “WHY ARE YOU JUST SITTING ON YOUR ASS WHEN MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW IS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH!” I tell her, kinda laughing because I was like wtf, “I don’t work here, I’m waiting for my friend.” She apparently does not believe me because she replies “clearly you aren’t WORKING since you’re sitting here! Is this your break?!” I ignore her, because I honestly don’t give a fuck and I’m not about to entertain this shit. She storms out, yelling about how she will just “find someone who cares.” Several minutes later I hear her yelling again, coming back towards the room. She has an actual nurse with her, comes in, points at me and screams “THIS IS HOW YOUR NURSES ACT?!” The actual nurse was very confused. I told her she thinks I work I here. The nurse, still kind of confused, is giving me the wtf face. I then get up, show the nurse and this crazy old bat, my work badge that is still around my neck. It clearly states *pharmacy name, billing department. This enrages the woman. I mean she flies off the fucking handle. “YOU NEED TO STOP FUCKING AROUND! THIS IS SERIOUS!” She continued making such a scene that hospital security had to escort her off the property. So, she missed the birth of her grandchild all because she wouldn’t listen to me and insisted I do my “nurses duty.” Grandma has some anger issues."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/de6mmy/i_dont_work_for_this_airport/,"I don’t work for this airport! I’ll go ahead and apologize for being on mobile.

So this happened recently while I was at JFK. Me and a few of my childhood friends have been planning on going on a two week on trip to Europe for years. 
We hadn’t actually gone because until recently most of them were in college and I was working full time (I am actually a pilot which was part of the problem). So this was our first big opportunity. 

I’ll go ahead and set up the cast. Me: Me, Security officer,  Karen, and ill call her Mary (Karen’s really embarrassed daughter) 

So at first it was a fairly normal trip to the airport. For me airports aren’t stressful As i generally have the run of the place, mostly due to my “known crew badge” with my picture and the airline I work for that let me pass tsa with some ease and go to the pilot areas. 

So while my friends are waiting in line. I walk over to the side and show my badge to the tsa guy with the wand and he begins scanning me.  I actually get through without much issue and turn to wait for my friends. 

That’s when I see Karen staring directly at me. We make eye contact and she waves me over. Now she is in the tsa line, not far enough along to take her shoes off. Now I can’t walk up behind tsa and I didn’t want to go back through tsa. So I shake my head not wanting to call out to her. I can see her face getting red. Now I’ll say, I don’t look close to an employee. I’m wearing jeans and a tea shirt (quite literally a Lipton shirt) and aside from my badge and my travel bag I look nothing like a pilot (and I’m only a FO). 

Seeing my non-compliance she immediately starts to shout 


Karen: What do you mean NO! You can’t say no to me. 


At this point the tsa officer who had wanded me walks over to her asking her to calm down. She just kept shouting 


Karen: don’t you tell me to do anything. My son is a platinum flier and he got me my tickets. You need to do what I say. 


While I stand there confused the tsa officer ask her to step out of line and she pulls poor Mary along with her. Karen looked as if she had won a great victory, and begins striking past the tsa officer towards me. 
The officer stops her and she turns on him 

Karen: Oh so your playing favorites now! You’ll let some employee walk through like he owns the place and step on customers but NOT A PLATINUM FLIER. 

The officer already fed up and I can’t blame him. But he waves me over with a sad expression. As he explains 

SO: Look, he’s a crewman. He flies for one of the airlines. That’s why he gets to go past. 

I held up my badge for he to see it

Karen: looking at me with her platinum hair fury: So you do work here and still try to ignore me. I’ll make sure you loose your job and your license for this. 

Me: what th-

Karen: I don’t want to hear a word from you if it’s not the name of your supervisor. 

Me: I don’t work here, I fly for (airline). And I. Am. On. Vacation. 

Karen: YOU just admitted you work here and yet you still ignored me. 

Luckily for me Mary was starting to get fed up with her mother and tried to cut in. Karen ignored her, yelling about her son and how he would get me fired and her “privilege” as a platinum flier. 

At this point I really hadn’t gotten in much of a word but I didn’t really need too because Mary finally got a word in on her mother’s mindless rant. 

Mary: you need to stop! Mom were going to get in line quietly and wait our turn. Otherwise I’ve had enough and I will simply leave you behind.

This shut her up and I took my opportunity to walk away as fast as I could."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/deczdc/new_employee_at_tire_shop_mistakes_me_for_fellow/,"New employee at tire shop mistakes me for fellow worker So this happened today when I went into town to get one of my car tires fixed. Had to borrow my dad's pick-up and I'm not a tall guy so it's rough getting in and out even with the small step hanging below the door. Anyway, it's pretty chilly so I just wore my heavy winter jacket. It's black/white/grey plaid with a hoodie but I leave it down since I can't detach it. Wearing big green mudboots and beige dress pants (I hate jeans wearing jeans, stopped 14 years ago), if I stuck out, it was more for crimes against fashion than anything else.

When I get to the tire shop, there's only parallel parking along the sidewalk right in front of the place and barely any at that but I manage to be a bit off to the side out of habit for emergency vehicle accessibility, unlike most people who are front and centre because they're too lazy to walk 10-15 feet.

There's a bit of hustle and bustle outside, which isn't totally uncommon but whatever, I mind my own business and prepare myself for a bloody long wait to give them my tire, let alone pick it up. I get out and spend a couple minutes trying to hop into the back (again, I'm short) of the truck to grab the tire. I finally get up and as I'm just about to turn it around to roll it off, this guy just starts heaving new tires into the back.

""Whoa, what the hey! What're you doing?"" I blurt out. ""You're late. These needed to go to \[whatever place they were going to be delivered to\] this morning. Just get it done and be back quick.""

""Uh...what kinda drugs you taking, buddy?"" Annoyed sarcasm isn't my favourite tone but he's being pretty dismissive. ""I'm here to get this tire fixed."" Now HE'S annoyed. ""I don't care, talk to \[owner\] when you get done. Just do your job.""

I am laughing in frustration at how ignorant this guy is (clearly a new hire) so I just start flipping the extra tires out onto the ground. ""I. DO. NOT. WORK. HERE. SHOVE. OFF.""

More concerned with what I'm doing than what I'm saying, he stops a couple from going into the street and runs inside. I get out with MY tire, close the tailgate and as I walk inside, the oblivious employee is bitching about me to the owner at the front desk. He is a friend of my dad's and recognizes me since our family just collectively puts all our purchases on his client file. Looking towards me, he asks, totally confused. ""Him?"" ""Yeah, him!""

I chuckle a little and say, ""I told him I didn't work here....."" Sighing and rubbing his face, the owner tells the new guy to ""just bring the tires in and leave 'em by the door"". Embarrassed but compliant, he storms off to do just that, giving me a dirty look as he walked past me.

""Sooooo...does your delivery guy drive a white truck? Had to borrow my dad's."" ""Um, no, he's got a blue work truck."" Realizing he was trying to be blunt and change the topic, I just let it be.

TL;DR - New tire shop employee thinks he's hot shit barking orders at me, thinking I work there too. Not backed up by his boss and mad to see me not get reamed for not doing what he wanted.

EDIT: And no, I didn't get to jump the line because of it. They were about to close before I got the call to come pick my tire up."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/ddzndv/psa_student_tour_guides_do_not_make_admissions/,"PSA: Student tour guides do not make admissions decisions In college I was a tour guide for prospective students (you know, walking backwards and telling scripted puns) 

Technically I was employed by the admissions office to do this, but in no capacity was I involved in admission decisions whatsoever. No one asked me “which kids asked a smart question” or “who texted through the whole tour” or anything. 

My entire job description was show up, walk the families around campus, answer questions about student life. For context, I’d give 3-6 tours a week to groups of 40+ people. 

So I was home for break one Christmas and in a large chain store I see a woman glaring at me. 

I didn’t think much of it at the time because I didn’t know her but as I progressed down the aisles I realized she was following me. She had a daughter about my age and they were whispering. All I was able to catch was “No that’s definitely her.” 

The woman approaches me and says “Are you [my name] who toured us around [my college]?” And I say yes. 


Woman: I bet you think you’re pretty hot stuff huh? 


Me: Oh, um... what? 


Woman: My daughter had a rock solid application and her alumni interviewer said her chances were “very good.” Two days after our visit she’s rejected! You’re the only one affiliated with the university we spoke to that whole time. 


Daughter: Yah! 


Woman: Quiet, I am handling this. 


Me: I’m sorry to hear she wasn’t accepted but I have nothing to do with admission decisions I just give tours. 


Woman: I’m not an idiot. I know they tell you to say that. 


Me: No, seriously, I’m a sophomore there myself. You can call and ask, I do not get any input into admissions. 


Woman: But you work for the admissions department? 


Me: Ok, technically they hired me but, like, there are janitors who work for the admission department and they don’t get to decide who gets in. It’s a specialized job. 


Woman: Quit your bull! 

Daughter: I had near perfect ACT scores. I bet I had better scores than you! 


At this point I think my mom thought I was just catching up with people I knew since there was a girl my age but she started to realize something was wrong at this point. 


Daughter: Just tell my why you didn’t let me in. You can tell me. It’s the past now. Just tell me. 


Woman: Was it a community service issue? Come on, be honest. You can tell us. 


Me: I really don’t know. I have nothing to do with it. I swear. You can actually call and ask and they will tell you tour guides don’t get to decide that stuff. 


Woman: You bet we will be calling and filing a complaint and—


My mom: Excuse me, what’s happening here? Who are you? 


Woman: Who are you?! 


My mom: Everything ok? 


I was getting upset by this point because a lot was going on and if you insist loudly enough to me that I’ve done something wrong, eventually I’ll start to believe you. 

Daughter: Is it because I’m white? 


(I’m a POC) 


My mom: Hahaha, what? What are you guys talking about? 


Me: Let’s just go. Let’s check out. 


Woman: Not admitting my daughter was the biggest mistake of your career! I’m a millionaire and I would have made big donations to the school. When your boss hears from me you’re going to be fired. 

I wasn’t even upset at that point because it was so absurd. (No way a millionaire would be shopping at the store we were in) 

My mom leads me away and looks at me, still very confused what’s going on. 

We bought our items and I was pretty rattled as I went to the car, but as I was explaining, the absurdity of the whole situation fully hit me and I just started laughing.

That gave me the confidence to go from 40 regular fit khakis to a 36 skinny fit red jeans. The pants fit perfectly and I had no trouble getting them off and on. On top of that, they were 50% off from $30, which I expected to pay, but I only paid $15 due to it being an online return.""

Thanks random guy that made me feel good enough to try on jeans I would not have believed to fit me 3 months ago.

Edit: I'm a guy lol."

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/ddt5w7/not_so_bad_karen/,"Not So Bad Karen So I had an r/IDontWorkHereLady experience today. I love thrift stores. I buy a lot of my clothing from them and some of my furniture. 

Well I was waiting for my mom in the dressing room and trying on sweaters. This Karen is watching me, adding running commentary and practically salivating over the sweaters I picked out. 

Well I have this maroon one with a cute cut at the bottom. Problem is it was way too tight for me. I don't like things that constrict my arms and like to have the ability to roll up sleeves. 

Karen also thinks this sweater is really cute. 

Karen: I love the cut. Can I have it if you don't grab it?

Me: Sure. 

I hand it over to her since it didn't fit right and go back to waiting. She's still staring at me almost expectantly so I figured I was in her way or something. 

Me: Sorry I'm waiting for my mom. Do you need me to move over?

Karen looks surprised. 

Karen: I thought you were the dressing room attendant. 

While I had a small laugh at it after the fact I can't help but wonder if the reason she was complimenting the sweaters was because she thought I was modeling them or something to sell. 

TL;DR: Karen stalks my purchases and explains it's because she thought I worked there."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/ddgkbg/give_me_that_funky_wheelchair_now/,"Give Me that Funky Wheelchair, now! Hello,

New member and poster here. My friends told me I should post this not only because it fits into the r/IDWHL category, but also to serve as a warning to let others know there are some really crazy nuts out there who have no comprehension or observation skills about how real life, and the lives of people, work.

A little background on me so you understand the serious situation this whole thing put me in. About six years ago I wound up with several health conditions that all interacted with one another creating a domino affect of health problems. During the course of those six years, plus this current year I have been hospitalized for no less than a week at a time, fifteen times. Despite getting most of the conditions stabilized I have a few more hurdles to overcome, those being one: a heart condition where my pump capacity is at %35 and requires me to get a pace maker, plus one leaking valve, and due to the low pump and all my hospital stays I've lost almost all the strength in my legs to where I toddle-wobble walk with a cane, but to truly retrain my legs I need to use a rollator (a stroller with 4 wheels and a seat). Also, my legs are so weak, I don't have the strength for the lift or push of the legs to get me up stairs and more especially getting off the floor or ground if I fall. Once I'm down, I'm down and it takes about two-three men to help get me upright.

So, one day I go to a store to grab some food and medical supplies. Won't say the store's name, but they usually wear smurf colored vests. I slowly toddle walk into the store, and that day I am wearing black jeans with holes, bright red suspenders to hold the pants up due to all the weight I've lost, a white short sleeved dress shirt, and a very bright and loud, red, green, and goldish colored plaid vest.

I don't even make past the security sensors when I'm suddenly grabbed from behind a woman who looks like she's never a worked a day in her life and done up to the nines so she looks like she should be shopping at high retail stores in New York or Paris instead of this local place. I'm going to call her Snooty. I know they usually call these ladies Karen, but my bonus-mom's name is Karen and she has never treated me badly, so Snooty it is for me.

Thus the playbill for this little production is going to be M=Me, S=Snooty, SS= Store Security, SM=Store Manager and of course, kind of piecing together what I remember of the argument/conversation.

As stated, I didn't even make it past the security sensors at the building entrance when S grabs me from behind by my right elbow and attempts to spin me around. I shift as best I can, rollator and all, and see this high falutin' lady with an exceptionally annoyed look on her face.

S: ""Excuse me, did you not see me try to flag you down? How could you miss us? You walked right past me and my crippled daughter."" (Her daughter isn't crippled, in fact all she has on is a brace boot around her left ankle and foot.)

M: (lost in a little bit of confusion) ""I'm sorry. I thought you were waving at someone you knew in the parking lot. Do I know you?""

S: ""No, you don't but you should pay attention to customers when you bring in the handicapped items such as that wheelchair. I flagged you down because my daughter needs it.""

M: (stammering a lil) ""Uh... I'm sorry but this isn't a wheelcha....""

S: ""Yes it is. This store provides them for handicapped customers and you need to do your job and give this one to us.""

M: ""Uhm... that's not my job. In fact I don't have a job. I'm in the middle of getting approved for disability.""

S: ""Really... what a world.  Anyone thinks they can get away with lying and excuses. Just give me the wheelchair, and I'll be nice and won't report you.""

M: ""I don't work here, lady.""

S: ""Yes, you do. You're wearing a vest and this is one of the store's wheelchairs."" (she places a hand on one of the bars on my rollator and grips tightly.)

M: ""No... I do NOT work here lady; I am a customer. I'm not wearing the right kind of vest, this item doesn't belong to the store, it's not a wheelchair it's a rollator, and the store doesn't provide wheelchairs they provide scooters which are located behind you. Let go of my walker!""

S: (attempts to jerk the rollator from me) ""I am going to report you for being rude to customers. Especially ones who are handicapped. You're not following the ADA laws. That'll get you fired for certain!""

M: (pulling back on my rollator) ""Again, I...DO...NOT...WORK...HERE! This doesn't belong to the store, it belongs to me. It's not a wheelchair, and your daughter isn't handicapped, she has a ankle brace on, probably meaning she just twisted or sprained her ankle! Grab her a scooter if you want, but leave me ALONE!""

S: ""More lies! MORE LIES! I am taking this wheelchair and I am going straight to the head manager to have you fired!""

What happens next is a tug of war (to the best of my ability) between myself and the lady with my rollator. She eventually does something kind of ""intelligent"" and she pushes on one of my pulls, which causes me to stumble backward, eventually tripping over my own feet and KA-BOOM down I go to the floor, landing on my right butt cheek and my shoulder and head slamming to the floor.  I'm in a tremendous amount of pain. The room and my head is spinning. The lady is saying something to me in scolding tones, shaking her finger at me, but my head is ringing, I'm now short of breath, so I don't really hear her nor understand her. She huffs and walks away and I was told she was slightly cursing as she was having troubles trying to push her daughter around in the ""wheelchair."" (note rollators are made so you walk facing the seat, thus the handle bars face out away, not from behind, the seat.)

Several minutes go by. Folks are trying to help me get up. Finally there comes in a gentleman and I believe his two sons, all of whom look like they could be professional line backers, who manage to get me up and escort me to one of the benches just inside the entrance doors. Just a couple minutes more and the store manager and a security guard come walking up to me with very stern looks upon their faces.

SM: ""We understand you we trying to take a wheelchair from a handicapped customer and that you were.... (glancing up and down at me) well obviously, attempting to pass yourself off as an employee of our store?""

ME: ""No... I was trying to come in here to buy some groceries and medical items, when this woman accosted me, telling me I needed to give her MY rollator.""

SS: ""Well, this woman said you tried to man handle her to take it away from her.""

I explain my medical conditions and how it's impossible for me to be able to manhandle anyone at the present time or foreseeable future. The man and sons who helped pick me up, informed the manager and security that I had to be picked up off the floor, that I had no leg strength as far as they could tell. After this the manager and security look me over and then look at each other with expressions that said this needed to be looked into further. The SS called for another security officer to have him/her find the lady and her daughter and bring them up to the front of the store. When they arrive, Snooty starts right on in.

S: ""You've got the right, or should I say the wrong, man. He needs to be fired, now! And I have a good mind to press charges against him and the store for his assaulting me.""

SM: ""Ma'am, I can't fire him as he doesn't work here.""

S: ""Yes, he does! He's wearing one of your vests!""

SM: ""You mean a vest like this?"" (he raises up a side of the vest he's wearing.) ""It looks nothing like our vests ma'am. It also doesn't have our name nor our logo on it.""

S: ""Well then, he tried to impersonate an employee so he could attack the disabled! I still wish to press charges!""

SS: ""Ma'am he says this stroller is his.""

S: ""This is NOT his wheelchair.""

M: ""It's not a wheelchair. If she owned it, she'd know it's not one. Also, if it was hers, why does she have my wallet and prescription list in the basket under the seat?""

S: ""That shows why you're not the owner. There's no basket under the seat!""

The SS politely helps up her daughter out of the rollator and onto a bench seat. Walks over and flips the seat up, revealing a little basket which contains my wallet and my newest list of prescriptions to order. S now looks up wide-eyed and somewhat terrified. SS tells his partner to make sure S doesn't go anywhere. SM and SS proceed up the staircase to the manager and security offices. They are gone for about twenty minutes and then come back.

SS informs S that the incident was all caught on camera and proves she's the one who started everything, accosted me, and then walked off with my rollator. She starts screaming and threatening the SS and SM with law suits and such, but is cut off when an ambulance crew arrives followed by the local police. The ambulance crew get the gurney prepped for me with the backboard and neck brace. Not that I needed it, but with the fall, they have to make sure I'm extra stable and taken in to see if I have anything wrong with my neck, back, or a concussion. They get me loaded and I'm waiting a few minutes when the police come back from the offices and ask me what I'd like to do. I can be a forgiving guy, usually given my mood and circumstances, but I was still hurting, in utter disbelief at what this lady did, and pissed off beyond all feeling. I let her have it. I told the officers I wanted to press charges for assault, and battery if I could get it, as well as theft of my rollator and my wallet.

I'm not sure what all happened to the lady, although I know she didn't help herself out. As I was being rolled out the doors on the gurney, I saw her break away from the police, take a defensive stance, and then she started flailing and smacking the officers with her purse and arms, as well as kicking their legs with her pricy, name brand pumps. It didn't take long before they had her face down on the ground, knees in her back, and the handcuffs becoming the next bit of bling around her wrists looking oh so plain compared to her bracelets.

I didn't have to do anything. About a week later I got letter from the county courthouse informing me that her case was already heard, the store video, SM and SS's testimony, as well those from a couple of other people who came forward after realizing what it was they saw when they walked passed us, was more than enough to convict her. I don't know if she served time in jail or community service, but either way, I hope she got to be seen in something either bright orange or maybe an old fashioned lil black (n white striped) dress.  


UPDATE INFORMATION:  


Apparently Snooty did make a plea deal (although some what heavily handed in being formed by the judge) the morning after her night in jail, when she appeared in front of the judge. My understanding is she pled guilty and served jail time for assaulting the police officers, resisting arrest, assaulting me, and some other charges that were listed, but they were in high legalese that I've not heard of so not sure what they were about.  Since she pled guilty to those items,   the judge went lenient on her for the theft of my wallet, she not knowing the rollator had a basket nor knowing or being able to see what was in the basket.  Not sure what he did about her taking my rollator.  She was also ordered to pay for my ambulace, ER visit, x-rays, scans, and prescriptions specifically related to my injuries from the incident, as well as being ordered to seek mental counseling/evaluation.  


So I guess the only thing left that folks have hoped she will pay for or I should do is sue for pain and suffering and the like in a civil case.  My lawyers assisting me with filling out and filling my forms for disability, etc. have already talked with me and submitted a civil case against her.  The first hearing is apparently in four to five months from now. (don't have my datebook in front of me.)  


For those asking about the daughter.  Yes, the daughter was aware that her mom was taking my rollator, but she didn't looked pleased about it.  She looked highly embarrassed.  She kind of assumed a slumping, ""let me hide under the table"" or ""melt and escape through the drain"" posture when my wallet was revealed and the thought of theft of that was mentioned.  I've been told she buried her face into her hands and began to sob greatly once her mother started flailing and kicking at the police officers and they took her down.  Other than that, I have no idea what's become of her or the affects of the incident on her.  My hope is that there is a good father in the daughter's life and that he's watching over her, hopefully away from the mother, but that's information I don't have access to, and am too busy with my own life, healing, and paperwork to go snooping around to find out."

This lady behind me says ""Excuse me."" and I turn around and look at her on instinct because I didn't think anyone else was around and made the correct assumption she was talking to me. She walked over and asked where liquid glue was. 
I said ""I don't know."" and she then realized I didn't work there.

I work for a university part time whilst doing a post-grad. I work in a School office for a particular subject doing admin work. 

There was a tap on the door and a student barged in. 

Student: Excuse me but there’s like a huge mess in the toilets? 

(Many of them speak like this - saying “like” and vocal fry / upspeak and it’s VERY annoying!)

Me: Okay, well if you have the university app on your phone you can self-report it. 

Student: Isn’t it your job as you like work here? Can you come and look at it? 

I sigh and follow her to the lavatories. One of the toilets has blocked and overflowed and the floor has flooded.

Me: Right, I’ll put an out of order sign on and put in a call to Facilities 

Student: You should clean it up, I want to use the toilet 

Me: There’s another one on the floor below you can use 

Student: But that’s your job! 

Me: I work in an office. Facilities management is done by a contractor. They have the right equipment to do the job. 

Student: Why are you so rude? Anyway you look like a fucking cleaner. 

I was wearing a nice wrap dress and heels. Not dressed like a cleaner. 

I glanced down at her student ID card and went back to my office and locked the door. She started BANGING on the door! I rang security and emailed the Head of the School and I found out who her personal tutor was and emailed them saying she had sworn at me and then harassed me. 

Security escorted her out of the building and she got some kind of written warning. Not seen her again.

It was such a weird situation like she wanted me (random person) to get down on my hands and knees to debase myself in front of her by cleaning up. That’s the impression I got from her."

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/ddczb0/found_stress_relief/,"Found stress relief So this happened over a decade ago, but it opened a door for a great stress reliever. I used to work for Blockbuster Video... Bacl when they had stores. Their uniform looked a lot like other companies, blue polo and tan khaki pants. Just a small logo on the left breast, easy to miss. As many jobs go there are always hectic days and/or times and at the time I was working 10-12 hour days due to incompetent staff. So on one of those bad days, after work I decided to go to the Best Buy down the street as I recently got paid and wanted to look for a new movie or series to take home.

As I am carefully going through movie genre sections looking for my bounty I am drowning out the lively spunds around me. This included missing out on the gentleman standing next to me whom must have been asking a question. I figured he may have been nicely asking before because by the time I realized his existence he was now talking AT me. The dead pan, emotionless look on my face further angering him. I'll have to paraphrase as like I mentioned this was a very long time ago. 

Man: I need you to get this item from the back. Right now. You were ignoring me. Don't make me call a manager.

Me: You'll be waiting a long time. Also, I'm not allowed back there. Find someone else that is better suited.

Man: Excuse you! I will be speaking to your manager immediately. This isn't a job for people like you.

Me: So you noticed hmm? Tell you what, go right ahead, I am sure he would love to hear your opinions. When you get back you can still wait. 

I knew he mistook me for an employee. I had been facing him the entire time with the logo of my shirt in clear view. This was just fun for me at this point. I bet my manager would have loved the conversation too.

Man: (Calls out to an actual employee walking by whom jogs over) This person needs to be fired! He is...

Me: (I cut him off) Yes! I demand you call my manager and tell him of my insubordination immediately. (The staff member is trying to not laugh as he is realizing the event in front of him as the man is seething) I shouldn't be working here since I am employed by Blockbuster and Best Buy doesn't sign my checks.

We both stare at him. He looks like all the blood in his body drained in a second. I smiled at the employee and tell him that the gentleman would like something and I am sure he will be much more courteous going forward. I looked at him directly and thanked him for the lovely experience and that I look forward to him stopping by Blockbuster sometime. 

From that day on, on cruddy days I would go into businesses with uniforms matching mine and wait for someone to mistake me so I could unleash all my pent up aggression dished out to me when I worked retail. Because, I don't work there. Enjoy the fun."

The uniform there is collared shirt of blue, yellow, pink or white, black pants, with a large brown apron with my name on it with at stars below it. I lived a while away from my workplace and id leave early to stop for a drink at wally world or something.

During summer id get stopped sometimes to help some people for some reason. One really stuck out though. Its not a bad one its just bizarre. 

I was speedwalking in uniform to get a tea before work cuz i wanted to get in and out. As i was leaving this elderly woman in a battery carts rolls out of an aisle and flags me down

Convo goes like this:

Elderly lady(EL): Miss please can you help us get this?

Me: huh? 

She points to an older short man trying to reach for some spice. I have a soft spot for older people so i smile and agree. 

Im on the taller side but i struggled to grab it so much i had to climb on the shelf. (Dont do that home kids) I grab the spice and the elder man thanks me. 

EL: Who knew walmarts employees were so helpful!

Me: (baffled at this seeing how i wasnt in blue but Brown.) Huh? Oh no ma am i dont work at walmart. I work at the -restaurant- a little away from here. 

EL: (surprised by this and embarassed) OMG I am So sorry! 

She starts apologizing for interupting my shopping and i just smile saying its fine and that im always happy to help. As i was leaving she said she was gonna call my work and tell them how helpful i was. I got mad props at the end of my shift from my manager.

I knew immediately that she thought I worked there because I was basically wearing the uniform,  but with the language barrier on top of the fact I was totally baked ... well there was just no way i was going to be able to explain this to her.  

So i spent the next 10 or 15 minutes leading her around trying to help her find some stuff, when i finally bumped into an actual employee and passed her off to that guy.

I was at the airport waiting to pick up my gf (she was gonna visiting me) and I had arrived rather early, like 30min before she was scheduled to land, just to be on the safe side, so while I waited I decided to just stand near one of the walls by the ""arrival"" gate, this wall was part of the security station (where you report missing luggage or passports, or you're taken there if you tried stealing something, you'd be surprised how often that happens), but I was still standing far enough away to not make them think I needed help, or be in the way for anyone who was arriving or actually needed the help. The security was to my left and on my right was a special employees entrance, where you needed a code to enter the baggage pick up station

I am standing there on my phone just waiting listening to music and texting my gf about how far along she is in the airport, when a family with a BIG TROLLEY, comes out of the ""arrival"" gate, I didn't really pay them much attention as they were certainly not my gf, but I did notice they had a lot of luggage (big family with at least 5 kids) thus the big 2 layered trolley, the family gathered their luggage and went towards the parking lot, one of the children (teenager, maybe 16?) stayed behind to park the trolley, he then must have noticed me cause he proceeded to take the trolley over to me, placed in in front of me, and then asked me ""Can this stay here?"", me already being in my own little world, just looked up for a minute or so and said ""yeah, sure.."", he proceeded to say thanks and walked away. 

It wasn't until 5 minutes passed that I understood what had happened. I thought for sure this guy was asking if it was ok for me to have the trolley in front of me, if it would bother me, or was in the way. I later realized, he was asking if he could leave it there to be picked up by the baggage handlers...I know I was standing near the security and employee entrance, but every employee at that airport, especially the ones working with your luggage, wear black/navy blue shirts, black pants, black leather shoes, and have a nametag/lanyard with the airport name on them, and on the back of their shirts it says what department they're with, I was wearing black jeans, a zip up hoodie, and sneakers/joggers (depending on where you're from), and I was listening to music. No lanyard, no nametag, oh also, I had my black backpack with me, and my sports bag next to me, there was in my head, no way he'd mistake me for a worker.

Yesterday I was taking my 11 month, recently walking, my Baby for a random exploration in one of our big stores. The uniform is a red polo and I was wearing a red hoodie.

We were just wandering aimlessly when my Baby made a beeline for a man in the hair dye aisle. The man smiled and said Hi to my Baby, which caused my Baby to do a u-turn and run away (Very very shy). I picked up my Baby and was about to leave when the man called out to me for help. 

I thought, oh no, he just saw red and thinks I work here!

It was much more adorable than that. He asked how old my kid was, which was a segway to, ""I have a 2 week old and my wife sent me here to find hair dye, she can't leave the house and I don't know what I'm doing, please help!""

He was holding an uncommon colour of dye (Grey) so I was immediately suspicious that he hadn't got the right one as the fun colours don't tend to be permanent. I asked him a bunch of questions to determine what his wife wanted, only to find that she wanted permanent grey which generally only hair salons do permanently. He told me he hadn't even read the ""Non-permanent"" label on the box. 

He ended up going for what he had originally as it was the closest thing, but now able to go home and proudly tell his wife about why he chose this one and sound all knowledgeable.

Let’s be honest we all know I tend to mouth off to people in public, but I can be nice. And yes I often get the truth police called on me. So today I’m going to share a now 8 hour old experience.


Preface: My cousin is a department head at the local national chain union friendly grocery store. You may know it by the large K. So after work (yes my work day ends at 1145 to 12 every day) I stop by and pester him. We usually just chit chat as he does his thing. Sometimes I walk in the back where customers don’t get to access normally.

After hanging out with him and doing a bit of my micro shopping, I walk on towards the register.

That’s when I feel a gentle tugging on my shoulder. Normally, I go from my resting bitch faced look to the sudden shtf face when people touch me. Yeah, I’m not much for unexpected contact.

I turn around half expecting somebody who may end up on the end of one of my rants. However, I notice a man maybe in his mid thirties looking like life may have handed him a similar hand that I had been dealt. He looked solemn initially. Within a couple of minutes I figured out he had a level of social anxiety that must have made speaking to me hard enough, let alone touching my shoulder

C: man
Me: that loveable asshole
E: employee


C: ex... excuse me sir (lower case because he’s mumbling quietly)

M: Could you speak up a bit? I can’t hear you. 

I’m hard of hearing. I wasn’t trying to be rude, but my vocal tones are a bit harsh.

C: Sorry. I just... I’m... I need help. Please.

M: Are you ok?

C: no...

M: Well what’s wrong?

C: I was walking in the dairy section, and I had my phone. Then... I didn’t. I don’t know what to do.  (He was quiet, but spoke very quickly)

We are near the soda aisle, which is only a few steps away from the dairy. It’s at this point I start connecting dots. He has a bit more than social issues. I don’t know how to put it without sounding insensitive.

M: Ok. Let’s go back and see if we can find it. 

C: thank you...

We walk back to the mill case since I noticed he was holding a small carton, and since it’s a start.  As we are looking an employee walks up to us.

E: Can I help you? 

M: Yeah. This man lost his phone back here. Can you go find Steve? He was just over here. 

E: He just went on lunch. 

M: Shit. ( and he didn’t invite me, but I digress)

E: Do you know the phone number?

C: Yes... it’s ###

M: Here, let me dial that. If that’s ok with you.

C: please... thank you...

Sure enough we heard the phone. He had sat it down on a carton of eggs a few feet behind us. He had a Dr Who ringtone. The Tardis sound effect. His eyes lit up like a kid at Christmas. 


The man thanked us both. He even mumbled he was going to brag on the two employees who saved his day. He was so happy and relieved that I didn’t want to ruin his excitement by correcting him."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dcv89k/looks_like_i_work_at_walmart_now/,"Looks like I work at Walmart now After watching a whole crap load of Reddit videos on Youtube, I thought it was about time I start entering some of my own stories. This one isn't a bad one but a funny one that happened to me not that long ago.

It happened in the beginning of August back in 2017, it was the first week back to school and needed to start shopping for the usual supplies. I had my mother drive me (didn't drive yet) to a Walmart in an area where she could just drop me off and take care of some errands she had too. I had just gotten out of school that's a uniformed school. The thing about my school's uniform, it looked practically identical to the Walmart uniform. Dark blue polo shirts and khaki pants that fit the bill. They do have two other colors: light blue and yellow, but I liked the dark blue better. As for the pants, we could either wear khaki or black colored pants. On that day, however, I had to wear the khaki cause my black pants were in the wash.

Aside from the colors, the only way to see that I wasn't an employee there was if you looked at my shoes and my school logo (a yellow shield with an ""R"" on the left-side of my chest). I walked around the School Supply area and picked up a few items: notebooks, benders, pencil bag holder etc. All being held in front of me from my stomach to chest, just barely covering my school logo. I went into another aisle to get my final items (sharpener or pens, can't remember), when I read a lady call to me.

Lady: excuse me, Ms?

Me: \*looks over to her\*

Lady: could you show me where the pencil boxes are? My daughter wants one that locks with a key.

Me: (remembering that I passed through that aisle a few minutes ago) sure, I'd be happy to show you

As I lead her down, I must've looked lost because I would double check aisles to be sure I found the right one. I'd almost get lost like that in stores like that as a kid. Once I found one I was confident in, I pointed it to the lady:

Me: they should be here, but I can't be too sure about that \*I smiled sheepishly\*

Lady: \*smiled with a bit of concern\* alright, thank you very much

Me: \*returned back to my searching\*

I felt proud of myself for being able to help her out, even if I wasn't completely sure myself. Once I got my things, I made a double check in case I forgot anything else before leaving. As I walked the aisle again, I saw the same lady talking to an actual employee wearing the Walmart vest (an older woman; OW). She noticed me and pointed me out, I was confessed and just watched giving a small wave. Both in shock and fearing that I somehow did something wrong when helping her out. The Old Woman looked to me and started to laugh a bit, looking back to the lady. I did hear everything she said but I heard her say, ""Oh no, she isn't one of worker.""

The woman looked to her in shock and looked back to me. I saw her eyes move to a spot on my shirt, I looked and it just so happened to show my school's logo. The woman laughed a bit herself and said sorry before returning to her shopping. It soon clicked in my head that she thought I was an employee and went to another to tell them about how I looked lost. Probably asking if I had gotten enough training before being put to work on the floor. I soon found myself chuckling and went on my way to check out of stuff. Before I left to self checkout, the OW came up to and grabbed my shoulder

OW: you're hired \*she smiled, still chucking\*

Me: \*chuckling as well\* oh sweet, I'll start tomorrow

And with that, I bought my supplies and had a funny story to share with my mom when she came to get me. She had a good laugh herself when I told her and made a comment about how if only it was that easy to get work."

This story is a little different. As I was the one who mistook someone for an employee.

I was at a well known uk clothing store where most of the clothes are for slimmer guys. Not somewhere I normally shop but I had a gift card. So I need to lose a bit of weight (working on it) and wonder if a couple of tops I like or in other sizes.
Now most of the staff here are young college types and wear Jean and t-shirts.
So I don’t know the uniform well accept for that so I’m lost I see two guys. Let’s call the Honest guy HG and joker guy JG. Me is me.

Me: (to HG) excuse me do you work here
HG: no sorry 
JG: I do mate 
Me: Great I’m sorry to bother you 
I hold the shirts and ask about sizes 
JG looks alarmed. In retrospect he was clearly mocking me and thought it would be obvious 
JG: erm I don’t really mate....

We stopped at the department store with the exclamation point in their logo.  I drove by a sign that said everything was 20 per cent off on Saturday.  He wanted to check out Halloween decorations for the house.  I wanted groceries at 20 per cent off.

Their dress code seems to be black T shirts with logo, and any pants (typically blue jeans) with name tag for cashiers, and button-up light blue shirts and black slacks (also with name tag) for management, but I'd never paid close enough attention before.

Son, 12 years old and about 5 foot 2 with long hair on a boy, worn down, was wearing black slacks and a hoodie that runs almost to his knees covered in skulls.  I, (45, M, long-haired man, worn in ponytail) wore blue jeans, untucked dark blue dress shirt and sunglasses.

We were in a random aisle when we started standing around chatting.  Our cart was two thirds full and I was just standing there, hands on the cart handle when a short woman presumably in her late fifties scurrried up to the kid and blurted ""Where's your bathrooms?""

He is a big fan of this sub and urges me to post, and has even watched the yOOtoObs of bots that read these, so he knew what was happening and started smirking, and isn't totally shy, but still looked to me to defer to me so he didn't have to answer.

Even though I clearly heard her, I think that blurting questions out like that is rude without some sort of greeting.  I turn my attention to her and say ""How ya doing?""

She now \*yells\* ""BATHROOMS!""  I still think she is rude AF, but think maybe its an emergency, so I point to the far corner of the store where the rest rooms are.  I say ""All the way to the back corner.  Normally, I would walk you over because it's not good customer service just to point..."" (She scurries off) ""but, (looks to kid,) \*say it with me..\* I Don't Work Here Lady!\*  You're probably out of earshot by now, but I said it out loud, so it counts.  I'm probably going to be writing about you on the internet later.""

I would have loved to have made this a teachable moment about how it's rude to blurt out single words when you are looking for help, but wasn't looking to fight that battle right then.

The son told me not to bother posting this one since it is kind of boring but I did.  It was notable.  It was his first."

I've always been a pretty tall lady (5'10"" in sneakers) so I'm used to having people all over flag me down to grab something that's high up, whether they think I work somewhere or not. It's not a big deal, and usually it's not even remotely memorable when it happens, but this particular instance makes me chuckle still.

YW - young woman OL - older lady

I was roaming the grocery store to look for brownie mix, and swung through the bread aisle on my way there to grab some bagels. As I was trying to find the ones I like, I could hear a conversation between two women to my right. They were speaking Spanish, so I couldn't really tell what they were saying, but eventually I heard something that sounded vaguely urging, and I caught a glimpse of the older woman of the two pointing at me. 

I can't help but look, and I notice the younger woman is in the store uniform. She comes over, and very sheepishly asks if I'll grab something off the top shelf. She and this older woman couldn't have been even 5 feet tall, so getting up there would've required a ladder. Or, as it happens, a tall awkward white girl. 

No biggie! I stroll over, grab the thing (which turns out to be hotdog buns) and hand it over. The older lady says, ""Thank you!"" in English, but the moment I smile and start to walk off, there's a rapid stream of Spanish, and YW goes, ""Oh, wait... She needs...""

So I come back over, and OL is pointing up at the rest of the hotdog buns.

YW: \[something like 'how many do you need?'\]  
OL: \[something I don't catch, but it's kinda long winded\]  
YW: \[nods\] She needs nine more.  
Me: Wow! Is there a party?  
OL: Si. Yes.  
Me: Oh cool lol

So I grab as many as I can standing normally, then go on tip toes to grab the few more that she needs. She puts them all in her basket, tells me thank you again, then turn to YW and says something. YW looks a little awkward, and replies, at which OL goes, ""Oh!"" and says something else.

Me: ?  
YW: She thought you were a worker here, and wants to apologize for bothering you.  
Me: \[is not wearing anything remotely like the store uniform\]  
Me: Well it's no big deal, I don't mind! \[to OL\] I hope your party goes well!  
YW: \[translates\]  
OL: Thank you!

So yeah! Nothing terribly dramatic, just something that amused me."

This isn't quite the typical IDWHL story and it doesn't have a big exciting ending but I'm just thrilled I can finally post something here because I love this sub.

So, I was in the service line at my local grocery store to get a money order because it is far cheaper than the bank. The line is very long so I take out my phone and browse Reddit to pass the time. Suddenly, I hear an ""excuse me"" from the man behind me. He nicely asks if he can use my phone to call his boss and that it was important. I obliged and he stepped out of line a bit but I could still kinda hear the conversation. It sounded like the person on the other line was furious and the man could only get in ""yes"" and ""okay."" It was a quick conversation and he gave me back my phone sheepishly and left the line. His boss must have really been upset to make him leave this line; it was extremely long and slow moving and we had been in it about 20 minutes at this point and weren't even at the front. However, I thought nothing of it. That was my mistake.

About an half hour later, I get a call from the number the man had called. It was a gruff sounding man on the other line asking me where I was, quite rudely I may add. I told him I don't work for him and hung up because I was driving. Mistake number two,

Later, when I am at my job at the library, I keep getting calls from the number. I work tutoring students so I ignored the calls but they kept coming. Finally, I pick up and our conversation went like this:

Me- Stop calling, I DO NOT WORK FOR YOU. I am at the library working with students and can't keep bothering with my phone.

Boss- Why on Earth are you at the library? YOU NEED TO PICK UP THIS FOR ME NOW

Me- I. DO. NOT. WORK. FOR. YOU.

Boss- You won't if you keep it up with this behavior!

I just hung up and blocked the number at that point. I couldn't deal with him anymore. I just hope I did the right thing, the man I let borrow my phone seemed like a nice guy and I don't want him to get in trouble. Sorry this ending wasn't too exciting!

EDIT: I did try to explain to the boss that I just let the man borrow my phone but that apparently went in one ear and out the other"

I was wearing a t-shirt with pusheen cat and regular jeans.

About 15 minutes into the shopping, I was helping my mother get something up high (She is shorter than me), and then she goes do something else in a different aisle, but I wanted to look at the aisle I was at. Then all of the sudden, this old lady wanted me to take her cart somewhere. So I just call this lady weird lady. Me = Me (wow what a surprise) and WL = Weird Lady.

&#x200B;

WL: (She was talking in some accent, Idk which one)

WL: Hellooo! Would you kindly take my cart to the lines? (She did extend the hello)

Me: Erm, sure.

So then I take her cart to the lines even though it was clearly on wheels and she can just push it... I then keep it in the line and she then asks me something very strange.

WL: Why not take it to the front of the line? You can do that for me right? It would be a favor!

Me: Um no I can't do that, you have to wait in the line like everyone else.

WL: Why not? Don't you own the store?

At this point, I'm really surprised how she thinks I, could run a goddamn store..

Me: Excuse me? I don't own this store nor do I work here at all, I'm a customer.

WL: Oh quit your nonsense! I saw you help that lady in the aisle!

Me: That was my mother though.

WL: Oh. (It just hit her now) Sorry.

Then she literally walks to a different line and keeps giving me a weird stare, at least it wasn't a stink eye.

I go back to my mother and tell her about the weird lady, and she just says forget it and then we leave with groceries.

A short weird story, but I decided to share it anyway even though it wasn't anything that big."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dcj4x3/i_dont_work_for_valet/,"I don't work for valet. Just to get characters out of the way:  
Me: Me  
V: Valet Worker  
ED: Entitled Dude  


This story happened a couple of weeks ago, and still fresh in my mind. I started my usual 30 min break at work, and walked to Chipotle since it is the closet, cheapest, and fastest restaurant where I work. The area I work at has lots of restaurants that are pretty expensive, and take awhile to get your food for a 30min break, but I digress.   


So my usual walk to Chipotle usually crosses the street to the other side of where I work, and there is a valet station that I pass by. I also always have my headphones on so I can listen to some music on the way there. Now the people that work them where a white short sleeve buttoned shirt w/ the their logo and black pants. The place I work at has us wear all black t-shirt, pants, shoes, and our logo is on the shirt. Well, as I was walking across the street, I see a man waiting at the station, but there is no valet there. I know he has seen what the valet looks like as his vehicle is not infront of it. He calls to me though anyways  


ED: ""Finally someone shows up! I need you to get my car pronto.""  
Me: ""I'm sorry sir, I don't work for valet""  
ED: ""Of course you're valet, why else are you walking up here?""  
Me: ""Just because I am walking in this general direction doesn't mean I am walking to the valet station.""  
ED: ""Whatever, just go and get my car.""  
Me: ""Sir, you saw me walk out of the store""  
ED: ""You could have been just been goofing (But he didn't say goofing) in there""  


From there I just roll my eyes and decided to walk away. I put my headphones back on, but that was a no no. He grabbed my shoulder, and took my headphones off.   


ED: ""Okay you little turd, get my car now!""

Before I could say anything, an actual Valet worker walked up and asked what is going on. The ED looked at him, and noticed that the logo on his shirt has the logo for the valet service. He gave me back my headphones, and took his arm off of me.   


ED: ""I'm so sorry, this man was trying to fake himself as a valet worker, and I stopped him.""  
V: ""Sir, he works at the store on the other side of the street. He walks past here almost everyday,"" (I go to Chipotle a lot) ""so I highly doubt he was doing any sort of thing. Now give me your information so I can get your car.""  
He looked at me next ""I apologize man, I can call the cops if you want.""

I shook my head because I don't have time to deal with it any longer, and I looked at the ED ""You should ask people first if they work here, and not assume that everyone is just goofing off.""  


ED tried to say something back, but I already put my headphones back on so I can go grab some food.  


TL;DR ED thinks I work for Valet Service though I don't wear the uniform for it."

I'm on mobile and I will fix any grammar mistakes once I get home from work. There is no real backstory, but I should mention that I come from a conservative black southern Baptist family, that I rarely see, so I can understand what happened. So I'm very liberal, Wiccan, don't listen to any rap and in general.

Now on to my story. One of the cousins that I'm closer too was going to be hosting the family reunion. We live in the same city so I agreed to help out with the setup and break down.

On the day of the family get together, he picks me up and drops me off at the hotel that was hosting us. My job was to set up the room we were using. Seeing I was the only one there, I set my computer up to the sound system. Metal and hard rock was my thing back then, so that's what I had played over the sound system.

At some point, family members start to arrive and just give me nasty looks. While I could tell they wanted to change the music and complain, but they left me alone. ( I'm going to say this now, looking back on this event I should have changed the music. Now, seeing no one said anything to me and left me alone, I was in my full right to play what I wanted. My music wasn't at an unreasonable volume and there was no vulgar language, unlike the music played later.) 

At some point, not long after people started to arrive, my cousin calls to inform me that he was there with the food.  I see this as a perfect time for a smoke break, as well and head outside to unload the car. After a couple of trips and a few cigarettes, we return with the food. The one thing that I remember walking in with that final tray of food was Metallica was playing.  I still had a few things left too set up, so I went back to work. It was around then that someone from the family finally approached me.

Woman (another cousin I think): excuse me, sir, you need to turn off this playings devil music before I go to find your supervisor.

Me: Uhm what?

Woman: I said turn it off or I'm getting the manager.

Me: Go on if you want, I don't work here lady! I'm here for the reunion and I'm more than be happy to change the music to something less hardcore, till Jason gets here to DJ.

It's around that moment that she noticed my pentagram pendant (as she called it) and goes off.

Sidenote: I was not and would never Force or push my view on others. After growing up in this family and being looked down on for believing differently, it's not me.

Woman: There is no way we have a devil worshiper in our family. I'm getting the manager to have you removed.

Sidenote: Now I want to add that she did say some other pretty hurtful and disrespectful things, but I don't want to go into it. 

Her saving Grace was my great aunt, who had just walked in. This woman pretty much raised me and know how I get when disrespected. ""Hell has no fury like scraps scorned"" She had no idea what was going on but said it looked like I was going to rip cousin Grace a new one.
She straightens out the whole mess and I changed the music, but not before I got petty, Lamb of God's Walk with me in hell petty.

For the rest of the night, I sat in a corner and gamed and chatted with some friendlier family members. At the end of the night, some of the family close to my age wanted to go clubbing. With most of them being from out of town it was me they had to come to again finding clubs.
I didn't want to be that asshole, so I made a few phone calls and got them into one of the better clubs VIP. (Advantages of having friends in high places.) That's my story and I'm sticking to it, hoped you enjoyed it.

TLDR: cousin at family reunion thinks I work for the hosting hotel, tries to get me 🔥.

For all saying I was being Disrespectful for wearing a symbol of my faith, have you ever been around southern Baptists. I could have been wearing a rosary and still got shat on.

The pendant in question: One point at the top within a circle and I still have it and wear it everyday.

As for the headphone: Unlike now, back then i didn't own a pair of wireless/Bluetooth headphones. I totally get why headphones are mentioned as this is a everyday issue i deal with."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dbk0f8/a_lady_and_her_husband_get_mad_that_i_dont_help/,"A lady and her husband get mad that I don't help them when I can't even do anything. So for context, I work for Company A and do a vast majority of work with them, but I also help out in Company B, since they have special tools that we don't for work they need, and I have the most experience.  They're not even 3 miles apart, so I don't mind.  So since I don't technically work for Company B and am more like a helping hand, I assume this is the best place to post it.  If it is better elsewhere, or not here in general, feel free to let me know.

I was over at Company B doing a small order for them, mostly just tedious mumbo jumbo.  Eventually I needed a specific tool, and to get it I had to go up front (Company B has a toolbox up front both for decoration and for extremely specific things), so I went up front to fetch it.  There I met two people, arms crossed, waiting.  One was a women who didn't at all look like a Karen, but she definitely had the attitude and I could tell just by being in her presence.  The other was I assume to be her husband, who looks like he frequents the gym and is in a tank top with some tattoos on his arm.  Our interaction is as follows:
Me - The main character, and narrator of this minor tale of woe.
Karen - The lady.
BD - Buff Dude
Manager - Company B's manager.

Me: Excuse me miss, I need to grab something from the toolbox behind you.
Karen: What took you so long?  We've been waiting where for 20 MINUTES waiting for someone to help us out!
BD: We had an order not too long ago that we need, now.
Me: Oh, sorry, I don't work here, but let me get someone who-
Karen: Bullshit!  I seen you here SEVERAL times, and you don't say you WORK HERE?! (Neither A or B have a uniform, so I can see it being easily confusing).
Me: I do not, however-
Karen: Stop with the fucking lies!  I want your manager, you're clearly a liar and you're harassing the customers!
BD: Karen just stop. (He then looks to me.) Just get who you need, but please make it quick.

I go to the back and grab Manager, and that was it.  Apparently Karen did this before and was banned from the shop after.  On the plus side, they got some pizza for everyone and let me take some before returning to Company A.  We all had a good laugh at the end lol

Edit: Since people were asking, no the lady and the buff dude did not get the pizza, Manager did.  Sorry lol"

This happened yesterday, theres a small shop close to my house and i usually go in there when i go home, their uniform is red shirt and black pants. My usual clothes are a plain red shirt and jeans, so its not uncommon for people to confuse me with employees, i usually don't mind and help them out if i can, but yesterday was a long day, school was extra long cause i got held up and i had more then usual homework (which means a LOT) also my mom wanted me to babysit my sister so i wanted to get home as soon as
Possible. I just had to pick cereal and some other things so i was in cereal isle looking for the one my sister likes and not paying attention to anything else when i was literally pushed by this woman (ill call her k as in  Karen because yea) 

K: um excuse me? I have been trying to get your attention for a minute now you should pay more attention to your costumers

Me: uh sorry are you talking to me? 
I usually take a while to figure out whats happening or what to say is something sudden happens also she nearly shouted and im not a big fan of loud noises 

K: yes you who else would i be talking to? Ugh why are all the employees so useless here

Me: oh uh um i dont- 

K: whatever just can you tell me where i can get (the chocolate she wanted)

I knew exactly where it was in fact i saw it earlier and i thought it would be easier to just tell her

Me: sure its ( telling her directions)

K: no it isnt, i checked earlier

Me : i dont know then they probably ran out

K: What do you mean you dont know cant you check?

Me: actually no becau-

K: no? Look here im really in a hurry and your not doing anything just GO AND CHECK 

I have anxiety and i get easily panicked at loud noises  she was shouting at me and i really didnt want to deal with this

Me: miss i dont work here so um, you can ask someone who does though

K: what do you mean you dont work here i demand you go and look or im gonna get you fired

I was about to cry but thankfully an actual employee saw this lady shouting at me and came over ill call her E , i know her( we have some mutual friends) and shes actually really nice, she recognised me and kinda got what the situation was

 E: can i help you miss

K: yes actually (she points at me) she being very rude to me and failed to do her job

At this point, my mom was blowing up my phone asking where i was( she does that when im late home)  i was VERY tired, and i wanted to get home as soon as possible so i thought i would just walk away but oh boy as soon as i started to karen went FERAL
she started shouting at me stuff like ""where do you think your going"" and ""did i stop talking to you?"" And ""you lazy shit come here right now"" the employee tried to calm her down and even threatened to call security but she just pushed past her and grabbed my by my arm and i just snapped. I yanked my hand free as fast as i could and on top of my lungs screamed at her "" I DONT WORK HERE MISS"" and just ran off by the time i reached home i was crying and my mom had to calm me down. I went by the store the next day and the the girl who helped me out apologised and told me that apparently karen didnt stop shouting and demanding her chocolate until they called security so yea, idk if i was overreacting but that was like third scariest thing that has happened to me in that shop

TLDR: lady wanted to get her chocolate and shouted at me because it ran out at the store i dont work at

EDIT: people are asking me what the other two scary stories were and one is a girl snuck her dog in (in her bag) and it ended up chasing me ( it was a small dog but im am very terrified of dogs:)

And my friends's (she works there) kinda crazy ex followed us to my house( we went there cause mine was closer) and now im kinda scared to walk alone

Also i hate shopping there but i live on the outskirts of a small town and its the only decent store around:( 
Also most of the people who work there are nice

Edit #2: all the people telling me i should have punched her im a 17 year old 5'1 girl who barely ever gets out, she was twice my size so i think your kinda overestimating me dudes:) idk about a throat punch , all i could reach are her kneecaps"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dbbpyt/youre_filipino_so_you_must_work_here/,"You're Filipino so you MUST work here This happened maybe three-four years ago, but it's one of those interactions that I haven't just forgotten.

So, first, a little background: My father used to work in China (he has since transferred to a different country), because of this I'd spend much of my childhood in China and Hong Kong. I developed a little ritual whenever we were traveling, which is really just me stopping by in the airport's bookstore(s) and bringing home my latest haul of books.

When this story happens, we were in HKIA and we'd already passed immigration. We were already inside, my mom and our bags were hanging by the gate waiting for boarding and, as usual, I'm in the bookstore looking for books I can buy.

I have my headphones plugged in (a Bose Soundsport wireless headphones) and my phone in my hand trying to look at Goodreads for rating and/or synopsis reference.

Because I'm a little paranoid about making a fool out of myself, I usually keep my music levels to a minimum when I'm out in public so I can hear people around me but because I'm fairly introverted, I keep both ears plugged in hopes that no one approaches me.

It usually works.

Usually.

But not that day. So, there I was, looking for books I could buy when this lady, *ehem* Karen, approaches me. She didn't look like a Karen, to be honest. She was taller than me (at 5'2'' nearly everyone's taller than me), she has long hair, and some trendy looking clothes-- she reminded me of the typical models you'd see in Chinese magazines, actually.

""Excuse me,"" she says. And my deeply ingrained instincts to be polite kicks in. I turn to her and ask, ""Yes, how may I help you?""

(Note that by this point I already have a book in one hand because she interrupted me mid-browsing through reviews of said book.)

K: I'm trying to look for this issue of [name of] magazine.
Me, confused but still trying to be polite: Have you checked the magazine stands?

I think the question might've ticked her off because I made her look stupid? The store was small enough that you can just stand in the middle to see the store's entirety. And, if you're trying to look for a magazine, the first thing you'll logically do is approach the magazine stands with labels for the word ""Magazine"" written in four different languages.

Which was what she did. Of course.

K, now looking annoyed: Yes, I already did that. That's why I'm asking you.
Me: I'm sorry, I don't know where to find the magazine you're looking for (I've never even heard of said magazine). Maybe you can go to the cashier and ask them if they know (at the point the only staff that was present was the cashier maybe 2-feet from us).

Then Karen looks more annoyed as she says: How can you not know? You work here?
Me, now realizing what's happening: Oh, I don't. I'm just looking for a book I can buy. (holds up book in my hand)

Karen looks less annoyed and more confused. She looks at the book in my hand, back to my face, takes in the clothes I'm wearing--and I think, ""Oh, she'll finally realize I don't work here because I'm obviously not wearing staff uniform (red polo shirt with company name, name badge, and black slacks,, compared to the all-black attire I'm wearing, black jacket, shirt, and leggings).

Then she says the magic works:

K: But you're Filipino?
Me, now surprised: Uhm, yes?
K, with all the entitlement possible: So you work here.
Me: What?

I'm Filipino, so I must work there.

For those of you who don't know, there are many Filipinos in Hong Kong (Filipinos, if I remember correctly, make up the largest ethnic minority in HK). Many of these Filipinos work as domestic workers in HK, so I guess the common (racist) conception is that all Filipinos in HK are workers there.

Karen is still waiting for my response, looking more and more ticked off.

I just stared at her, eyebrow raised and lips pursed, trying to summon all the sassiness I possibly could.

After a while, the Karen seems to get flustered by me staring her down. She mutters an excuse and shuffles along to the cashier who helps her.

I mean, that's it. It's not a super exciting story, just incredibly annoying. The dumbass, racist stereotype that reduces Filipinos to such a degree that any sort of identity beyond (domestic) work disappears makes me want to strangle some people.

I have massive respect for Overseas Filipino Workers. I grew up knowing a whole network of OFWs because my dad's an OFW and all these people have becoming our extended families. Which is why I hate it when other people look down on Filipinos for being (domestic) workers overseas. Seriously, once upon a time while attending international school-related event, somebody told us Filipinos aren't supposed to be good in English because ""[we're] domestic workers anyway"" (story for another day and under different subreddit).

But yeah, thanks for listening. :p"

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dbefo5/card_sharks/,"Card sharks So this just happened to my sister this morning; she actually had to call me and tell me about it. She merchandises greeting cards for a company that has a name like ""Ballmark"". She's done this for years, and it apparently pays pretty well, for job that's essentially tidying things up. Even so, she has shared some real horror stories about customer bad behavior.
This morning she was working away and some elderly woman came up and started taking boxes of new cards out of her shopping buggy, and said ""I need this. You can go get another cart."" My sister responded ""I'm here working Ma'am. You'll need to get your own cart."" Anyway, the situation deteriorated very rapidly with the woman grabbing her wrist and slapping her, saying ""I know how to deal with your kind!"" A store employee witnessed this, ran and fetched the MOD. He gave the woman the opportunity of either apologizing or being banned from the store. She still insisted that my sister be fired, so he banned her. Apparently that's the only grocery that the senior shuttle goes to, so the woman is SOL. The manager wound up giving my sister three $50 store gift cards, after she agreed that she hadn't really been assaulted."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dbhj0m/im_brown_so_i_obviously_work_here/,"I’m Brown, so I OBVIOUSLY work here. This may not be as exciting as other stories (no police, no arrests) but its an IDontWorkHereLady story nonetheless.

Some backstory: I’m a Sikh teen who wears a turban, second generation immigrant who was born and raised in Canada. 
I live in the GTA (greater Toronto area) which is known for it’ diversity.

In this story however, I was taking a weekend trip to Niagara Falls, as many Ontarians do. Outside of the city, there is a smaller town that is called Niagara-on-the-lake that is home to a pretty nice outdoor outlet mall that I though I should visit. Now unlike the Toronto area, this small town was almost all white people and had little to no diversity. So my family looked pretty out of place. 
I was in an under armour store and was about to put back a sweater I didn’t like, when a lady asked me 
“How much are these sweaters?”

Me: “I’m sorry, I don’t work here.”

Her “ oh, I’m so sorry, you were just putting back the sweater really nicely so I thought you worked here, eh.”

Me “ it’s okay, I try to not make the employee’s job harder”

She was then really apologetic, and it was just an honest mistake.

Later on in the day, I was walking around a store when another lady asked me
Her “ Hey can you check if you have a medium in th-“

Her realizing I’m not wearing the same brand as the store I’m in.

Her “do you work here?”

Me “No, I don’t, I’m sorry.”

Her “ oh... Sorry”

This time however I wasn’t doing anything that would signal I work there.

Finally, I was in a different store, just browsing when yet again a different lady asks me 
“ Do you know where the purses are?”

Me  for the third time “ I’m sorry, I don’t work here.”

She just walks away.
This is when it finally clicks. They though I worked here because of what I look like (with the exception of maybe the First Lady). Like what could a brown guy possibly be doing at a mall other than working there, like I don’t know, maybe shopping?

Now I acknowledge none of them were rude in anyway but I was certainly confused at first as to why everyone though I worked there. This goes to show that sometimes for people who live in small towns without diversity, your brain is sometimes instinctively racist without you thinking about it.

A side note, definitely visit the mall if your in the area, it’s called Outlet Collection Niagara, it is outdoors, has all the brand names, and is dog friendly.

TLDR: Three different ladies think I work there because I’m brown."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dbj85j/wholesome_misconception_by_my_not_so_direct/,"Wholesome misconception by my not so direct co-workers First post (EVER, have mercy please). English is not my first language and i’m on my phone.

So I work/am an intern under service desk in the elderly and rehabilitating care, we have 10 locations where I sometimes have to visit when having serious hardware problems or when we have hardware upgrades. Being young and in IT they are not too strict about my dresscode or anything. Co-workers must wear a badge and workers pass cause we need to get in co-workers-only areas sometimes.

At this point i was fairly comfortable with the locations and my internship and always prepared myself with some quick fix food, when going to locations, but i occasionally needed a boiler for this. This specific location has multiple shared living/kitchen spaces in connected linkedhouses.

This one day i was checking some routers with my team and staying there the whole day for check ups and more. I brought some noodles with me since i knew (almost) every location has acces to a boiler and figured i just asked the receptionist and help myself. 

So there i was; just me, my phone and my noods waiting for my hot water when someone came into the living/kitchenroom and started talking about one of the elderly there and randomly asked me; ‘if i knew she took her medicine’. I, as a quick confused and startled person, just stopped everything i did and looked her dead in the eye with confusion and said; ‘excuse me, what did you say?’ She looked at me, to my phone and back at me and repeated herself  while laughing. Maybe she figured i wasn’t paying attention?

While she was repeating herself some other nurses came into this room aswell, noticing our conversation and greeted me and introduced themselves. I was still very confused at w h a t was happening here and just went with it and introduced myself, f o r g e t t i n g the part i’m with IT and just say nothing else but my name.

When suddenly one of the nurses asks me if i’m a intern or a co-worker and since when i have been working here. It was at this point where i noticed everyone was wearing a light blue blouse, some jeans and a badge. I’m used to nurses wearing white or light blue uniforms so i wasn’t prepared for this one. I was actually in my casual clothes DRESSED CLOSE TO ALL THE NURSES THERE. Light blue (XXL) blouse (opened since it was a hot summer day), white shirt underneath and jeans. I shyly laughed it off saying; ‘Sorry, i’m not a nurse, i’m an intern for IT. We’re actually checking issues for this location.’ 

Everyone just lost it at this point, including me. We had a good laugh, made some jokes and i went along my day, feeling funny and satisfied, with my noods. 

Also; if you made it till this point, i’m so sorry for the long story. It maybe could’ve been shorter but i rly like writing and tend to think i miss important details, like i said have mercy pleeassee. <3"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/db03e9/karen_insists_she_doesnt_work_here/,"Karen Insists SHE Doesn't Work Here A little background: I have an almost 2 year old who is a bit of a finicky eater, as many kids that age are. There's one brand of little, blueberry flavored, heart-shaped rice puffs that he absolutely loves, and we use them as rewards for when he accomplishes something, like successfully using the potty or putting away his toys. Sometimes, we also give them to him just because we love him. He calls them ""Puffs"" and practically chants it when he knows he's about to get some. It's pretty adorable, but I digress.

Now, I'm a 6'3"" man and very broad shouldered. I'm a pretty calm, pleasant person most of the time and try to make friends with everyone I meet, but I've been told that I'm intimidating just because of my size. I'm aware of this and try not to loom over people or throw my weight around, but sometimes people get skittish just because I'm there.

So, anyway, I'm at the major chain grocery store after work picking up a few things that my wife asked me to grab on the way home. I remember that we're low on Puffs and swing by the baby aisle to get some, even though my wife didn't ask for them specifically.

Lo and behold, there's Karen in her smart business casual jacket with her overloaded cart standing right in front of the Puffs. She's holding a box of baby oatmeal reading the back of it. I calmly watch as she puts the box back, picks up another box of the same brand of the same powdered oatmeal, just a different size, and starts reading that. Again, I wait, but I'm standing there wondering what could possibly be different between the two. She then picks up the first box and starts comparing them. They're identical other than box size, and I'm tired of waiting for her.  

It's only been two or three minutes, which isn't that long, but I'm ready to get home to see my kid. So, I say, ""Excuse me, ma'am. Could I...""

**Karen**, without looking up: ""I don't work here.""

**Me**: ""Right, could I please...""

**K**: ""I said I don't effing work here!"" Except she says the word as she glares death at me.

**Me**: ""Yeah, I get that. I just need...""

**K**: ""Get away from me! Just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I'm going to help some idiot man buy baby stuff!""

**Me**: ""Look, I just want that cereal,"" I say as I point at the Puffs on the shelf.

**K**: ""Don't touch me! I said I don't work here! MANAGER! I NEED A MANAGER!""

Now, there was a nice older lady stocking shelves at the other end of the aisle. I've talked to her a few times over the past few months. She's always been really sweet and always tells me all about her grandson, who coincidentally has the same first and middle name that I do. She knows me, so I'm not worried when she heads over. She's not a manager, but being older, a lot of people assume she is. I'll call her **W**, for Worker.

**W**: ""Is there a problem here?""

**K**: ""This man is harassing me!""

**Me**: *sigh* ""I just wanted to...""

**K**: ""I don't care what you want! I won't be bullied!"" Turning to W, ""I demand you have him thrown out! I won't put up with this!""

**W**: ""Ma'am, can we please calm down? I'd like to...""

**K**: ""Don't you tell ME to calm down! He's the problem!"" To me,""I said I don't work here! Eff!""

**W**: ""Ma'am, I can't help you if you don't calm down. Please, can..."" She turns her hands palms up in a pretty universal nonthreatening position.

**K**: ""Don't you touch me! I'll call corporate! What's your name?!""

I've been pretty irritated, but I haven't gotten mad until now. I worked customer service for a lot of years and am used to being treated poorly by seemingly insane people, so I've been trying to remain calm. Once she threatens to report the sweet old lady for just trying to defuse the situation, I get angry.

Standing up straight, looming forward just slightly, and with my best semi-loud dad voice that I usually reserve for when my kid is about to do something that's going to get him seriously hurt, I say, 

**Me**: ""Lady! I just wanted to buy that cereal for my kid, and your cart is in the way. I KNOW you don't work here. I'm not an idiot. I was just trying to ask if I could reach past you to get it.""

Karen goes completely pale and frankly looks like she's about to wet herself. She silently grabs her cart and scoots it back two or three feet. I smile and say in as calm and friendly of a manner as I can manage, ""Thank you, ma'am."" I grab the Puffs, put them in my cart, and walk away.

**Me**: ""Have a nice evening.""

A few seconds of silence pass as I walk towards the registers, before I hear **W** say, ""Ma'am, if you still need that number for corporate, I can get that for you."""

I actually find my story pretty hilarious. I work in a small town at a worldwide corporate restaurant. Being that the town is so small, all of us bartenders know each other very well, so when my coworkers and I go out after work, we treat our bartenders as friends. Because, you know, they *are*.

Our uniforms are basically jeans and a T-shirt with a HUGE corporate logo on the front. It’s pretty hard to not know immediately where I work. If you’re sober. Drunk people have a tougher time. Especially at the small watering hole that the whole town frequents late at night.

I’ll be doing my thing: boppin’ around, talking to regulars, talking to the girls behind the bar... As the hours go on and people get more drinks in them, the distinctions between myself and the actual bar employees get blurred.

I’ll be walking out the door to smoke a cigarette and people will be like, “Hey, can we get three more?” I’ll be off in a random corner by myself playing word games and decompressing and someone will walk up to me and say, “Hey! Can you guys make mojitos here?” I walked into the restroom and a girl was like, “Eyyyyy! Finally got a restroom break huh? You might wanna bring some more paper towels! You guys are busy!” Standing outside: “Miss, can I pay you?”

I used to point to my shirt and explain that I didn’t work there. To be fair, I just leave my name tag on so I don’t lose it. But I would just be met with blank stares.  Now I just kinda walk up to the bartender and say, “Hey, C-3 wants three more,” and giggle about it. Because I know the table numbers there, too."

This happened around a year ago. In my earlier years I have worked in a supermarket as a shelf stocker (good description?), after that even if I got asked for directions in a store and I know it, I'd point them in that direction.

We have a certain store, like a dollar shop or comparable if Aliexpress would open up a shop around the corner (with dito low prices). The uniforms they are wearing are nothing more than dark (navy blue/black) jeans and  a blue polo shirt with a colored stripe and their company name on both sides.

Here is me: My favorite outfit for the day was a regular blue jeans, blue t-shirt with different prints on the front and back (all white letters and icons). After searching for that one thing I couldn't find, I walked up to an employee and asked for that thing.

Employee: Oh, that's over there and there. 
Just before leaving the person behind me asked for the same thing. As I overheard this, I told the customer to follow me as it's the exact thing I was looking for.

After that I immediately got asked by another customer (Customer 2) to check this weekend's promotions. I just replied ""Sorry, I don't know"".
Customer 2: ""Why don't you know that? Isn't that your job?""
Me: ""No, because""
Customer 2: ""Go get one of your colleagues then""
Me: ""But I don't work here""
Customer 2: ""You helped that other customer, so you can help me now""
Me: ""That customer just wanted the same thing as I. Do I  wear the same uniform as the others?""
Customer: ""Maybe you're just off duty, I need someone to help me""
Me: ""I'll get someone""

And on my way to the check out point I told one of the employees that someone needed help with something and she confused me for an employee.

The employee laughed about it and walked to the aisle. No idea if the customer was helped at that point. But I was away from her."

Firstly, some context: (TLDR BELOW) I used to volunteer at an RSPCA charity shop as three months voluntary work was a qualification I had to have so that I could complete my bronze DofE. The staff were nice, mostly being older women over 40 who put me to work cleaning and making tea though there were rare occasions where I worked the till which were always nice. Though most days were quiet I’ve got one or two stories from regulars I can hopefully share at other subreddits in the future. Most of these stories involve theft though the shop did try to prevent this by keeping certain items that come in pairs, such as shoes, separated so that you’d have to ask for the other half before purchasing.
(TLDR: I volunteered at a charity shop to earn a qualification where they put one shoe on display and keep the other one in the back so if you wanted to buy one you’d have to ask a member of staff to fetch it for you.)

I recently came back to this charity shop to pick up some children’s books for my younger brother and to say hi to some of the ladies I particularly liked. While shuffling through the 50p book basket, I hear a loud “Excuse me!” to my right. I briefly glance right and up to the what will turn out to be the Karen of our story. Immediately I straighten up and move to the side, apologising, assuming I’m blocking the aisle.

Karen: “Actually, I asked you if i could have the other half of this.” And she hands me a shoe. This time, I look at her properly and realise she was one of the regulars that frequented the shop when I was working there. No big deal, she thinks I’m still employed.
Me: “I’m sorry, you’ll have to ask [cashier] when she gets back, I don’t work here anymore.” I go to hand her the shoe back. Karen pushes it back to me.
Karen: “You’ve done this for me before, you can do it again, just go and get the shoe!”
Me: “I’m not allowed back there, you’ll have to wait.” Karen, with an exasperated sigh, snatched the shoe back to her and stalks off to the other end of the store.

 That’s the last I saw of her as she soon (about five minutes of mumbling and dramatically huffing later) got fed up of waiting for any other employee to see to her and left in a strop. It’s definitely not as crazy or dramatic as any other story on this subreddit and I’m on mobile so the layout is probably terrible but it’s my first post so I’m sure I’ll get the hang of things as I tell more tales."

Not for this lady. I nipped into the DIY store right next to the stadium where I was about to go on duty to pick up some paint (kill two birds with one stone journey).

As I couldn't find the paint I asked an employee to check when the paint would be in stock so she took me to the counter to check the system. 

At that point, a woman down the aisle loudly declaring ""I think I'll have a tester pot of the lilac made up"". As her partner was following behind and all the employees in that area were clearly  already with customers, I and the employees assumed she was talking to her partner so she got no response.

My uniform is all black and very clearly has xxxxx Ambulance written on the front and back and the employees at this shop wear orange aprons so I didn't think I could be confused for an employee there. 

However, apparently it wasn't obvious to this woman who only seemed to appreciate that she may have made an error when I responded with a blank stare to her ""You do work here"" statement. 

Even after this, she didn't seem to reconsider her behaviour so rather than wait quietly in a queue, she just moved to the centre of of the counter area and declared again that she wanted a lilac tester pot made up. I just walked away at this point so didn't get to see how she would cope with having to wait to be served.

Edit: realised I missed the colour of my uniform from that sentence. Also, thank you to whoever gave me the gold."

English is not my first language, also on mobile. 


Ze background:


My grandmother had an ""emergency"" which was easy to fix (new rechargeable batteries for the phone). Now i work as a n electrician for small company on the other side of town, and decided to save gas and time. So i went to a larger tech store about 5 minutes from where my grandma lives, still in work clothes (no uniform, no logo, no nametag. The store uniform is a black and red shirt with logo's and store name on the back, the sleeves and the front. 


Cast: K=Karen, M=Manager, Me=annoyed 24yo bear


I was looking at rechargeable batteries, trying to remember if my grandma needed aa's or aaa's. That's when i heard the words that cause so many nightmares: ""Excuse me, are you done standing around, I need you too find me xyz. "". I just looked at her for a second, ready to blow up after 10 hours of entitled clients when it hit me. My niece just discovered the word ""why"". It's frustrating. It's perfect.
So i put my goofiest smile on and the following conversation ensued:


Me: ""Why?""


K: ""Because it's your job!""


Me: ""Why?""


K: ""Because you work here!""


Me: ""Why?""


K (now yelling and getting red): ""YOU WEAR WORK CLOTHES! YOU WORK HERE! YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!


Me: ""Why?""


K: STOP THIS B*LLSH*T OR I WILL GET YOU FIRED!


Me: ""Why?""


Now at this point an actual employee came into the aisle to see what the yelling was about, her face said nope and she left. I continued my act of why-olence with my goofy smile when the employee came back with a manager. 


M: ""Ma'am, i have to ask you to stop yelling. It's disturbing other customers.""


K: ""Took you long enough, i want this moron fired or at least written up for how he treated me""


M: ""He doesn't work here, he doesn't even wear a uniform. Why would you think he does work here? Now, you either apologize to him or leave the store.""


K: ""Why do i have to apologize? He never said he that doesn't work here""


Me: ""Why would i?"" 


K (screaming again) : ""YOU ARE ALL MORONS! I WILL CALL CORPORATE ABOUT THIS!""


With that she stormed of, but i couldn't help myself: ""WHY?""


After that the Manager apologized and bought the batteries for my grandmother. No Cops, no coupons just a fun story. There is so much we can learn from little kids.    

Edit: holy shit, silver and gold! Thank you so much, i never expected that from my silly story. This realy made my day :D

Also, someone in the comments got downvoted for asking in someone could narrate it. Please do so Karens get to fear the mighty 3 lettered word! Spread to known world!

Last night was a typical Friday night for me.  I work for a transport ambulance service in my area.  We wear blue polo shirt with a black stripe down the sides.  It also has a very bright silver/gray 'EMS'  screen printed on the back.  This way, you can tell we're supposed to be on the ambulance.  Well!  On my way out of the office I get a call from my husband saying, ""could you please go get us a new floor lamp.  I'm so tired of using the fan as a room light.""  I totally get this.  Our living room gets a bit to bright to enjoy watching some American football (WE ARE!  PENN STATE!) when you have that light on.

So, in a moment of either not paying attention to the city traffic, or having a total brain fart after a 2 1/2 hour travel from Pittsburgh, I parked my mom van at the local WalMart.  This doesn't feel awkward to me.  I go to Walmart all the time in State College or Clearfield.  I wear EMS stuff all the time.  Mostly because it's 90% of my wardrobe.  I grab a cart that actually works and I attempt to find housewares for my new floor lamp.

After passing on that $60 coffee pot that I could have used... i finally find what I'm looking for.  While on the phone with a friend/co-worker I debate which lap looks good.  Should it have shelves?  Should I get the squid looking one we had before?  Was my husband just too lazy to replace the light blub in the light we had because he didn't like how tall it was?  Who knew.   I had just made my decision about my lamp when I hear,  ""excuse me!  Do you know where your towels are?""  OMG!  This person thinks i work at walmart!  I'm living a reddit story!

I turn with a smile and my keys around my neck on a PSU lanyard (Sorry, I'm a Penn State Fan.)  ""I'm very sorry, I really don't.  I don't work here.""  At that point I point to the transport company's logo on the left side of my shirt.  She puts her hands over her face and instantly blushes.  ""OhMiGosh! I'm so sorry! "" She turns, and walks away.   As she walked away I heard her say it was my lanyard that made her think I worked there.  My friend/co-worker giggles in my ears.  ""You were wearing you work shirt at walmart, weren't you? ""  she said.  ""yeah, just a little.  Not like I had anything to change into.""  We both laughed and I finished my shopping in peace."

Anyway there are two problems with this shop:

&#x200B;

1. There aren't enough staff (only 5 at any given time excluding security and this is a massive place)
2. Dates are almost completely illegible (the numbers are squashed, look samey and sometimes double print on each other)

&#x200B;

So me, being the only person under 40 and over 7 to ever set foot in this shop I've become the date reader. It always starts with some old lady asking me if I can read the date on an item and then spirals into about 6 people saying things like:

&#x200B;

""The dates have only been like this for the past year! It's Ridiculous""

&#x200B;

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/dabirg/i_have_resting_retail_face_i_guess/,"I have resting retail face I guess. I worked at a popular craft store chain for about a year and dealt with plenty of nice people as well as plenty of morons. But since I stopped working there I've been mistaken for an employee at many places a lot more often. 

I think part of it has to do with the fact that I might spend awhile looking at a few different options for any given product to see what's best for the price, as I know many people, after buying an item once, will get the same thing every subsequent time they need to buy it. Idk I like to really know my options. 

I also put things back where I found them rather than leave them on a random shelf or on the floor. 

Now that's important because showing a tiny bit of respect for the hard work people who restock do, must mean I work there. 

So I'm at a store I'll refer to as Damily Follar (sells a bit of everything at very cheap prices, perfect for me, a college student) and an older gentleman comes up to me and asks if there is any more x item in the back. I try to be very polite, but I was a bit caught off guard, so I just said ""I'm sorry, I wouldn't know.""

He just responds with ""ok"" and leaves. I glance over and see that he's going back to who I assume was his wife. I guess he told her what I said and she was not pleased because she shot me the dirtiest look. 

I had a can of spaghettios in my basket but I realized they weren't the normal kind so I put them back. So saggy bitch comes over and says to me ""so how is it that you're restocking but you don't know if you have any more of this item?"" I was really confused and got really anxious because some random woman was upset with me and I didn't know what to do. I had a stutter that usually isn't a problem for me anymore but when I'm nervous it kind of comes out. So what I said kind of came out like ""I d-d-don't, I'm-mm not a restock- I'm not restocking""

She responded by mocking my stutter like ""I-I-I'm n-n-not res-st-st-stocking!"" 

The husband spoke up and was like ""honey I don't think he works here"" but she got really defensive and insisted I did and that I just didn't want to look in the back for them. She said some dumb bullshit like ""I know how the employees here are, they're lazy assholes. You don't want to promote that image, do you?"" 

I felt really sick from this encounter this far and I hate to admit it but I started crying a little. The husband got really upset at his wife and was telling her to drop it. Finally he asked me, ""Buddy, do you even work here?"" And I shook my head no and he shouted ""Come on, Mel, really?!"" very aggravated at his wife. They finally left me alone and I called my mom to tell her what happened to I could at least try to laugh about it. And they were all out of the regular spaghettios but it's ok pb&j will suffice"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d9ya64/confused_for_an_employee_five_times_in_three/,"Confused for an employee five times in three different stores Last week I (26 m) went furniture shopping to fill up my new appartment and was looking for very specific things, so i drove around to a bunch of different stores. 

In the first store I went to I had the first ""incident"". I was talking on the phone when I feel a tap on my shoulder and turned around to see a little old lady asking me nicely if we hade the sideboard she was looking at in different wood colours. I just responded slightly confused that I did not work there and had no idea, but pointed out that I saw an employee walking past here a few minutes ago and sent her in that direction. Nothing too crazy, I just figured she saw me talking about the displayed furniture on the phone and figured I worked there.

10 minutes later I was still in the same section, not being able to settle on anything and already on my way out, when I hear someone clearing their throat behind me. I've read a lot of stories on this subreddit and I was already confused for an employee once, so I kinda knew what was coming. I turned around, was promptly asked by a less polite middle aged woman where a certain section was and I truthfully replied that I had no clue and just walked away. Now, I wasn't wearing something flashy, only a plain black t-shirt and blue jeans and the employees at the first store wear very flashy polo shirts in pink, green and yellow with the company's name in large letters on the front and back, so I have no idea where they got the idea from.

Since I still hadn't found what I wanted I made my next stop a very famous furniture store with a blue and yellow colour scheme. Again, you'd think with a black t-shirt I don't fit into the expected mold of an employee there. Not to make a long story longer, I was confused with an employee there again ... twice. At this point I wondered if I was actually wearing something I wasn't aware of or if me walking around with my phone in hand (comparing prices and pictures) looked like I was doing inventory. 

After disappointingly finding nothing I liked, I made my way to a third store. That store didn't have a uniform, the only thing giving away the employees were nametags clipped to their chest. At this point I want to stress that I did not wear a name tag, because apparently that wasn't obvious as, after 10 minutes in the store, I was cornered by a slightly older couple and told to order them some furniture to have delivered. I did not even get a word and couldn't tell them I did not work there before they had shoved the order form in my face. I finally got a word in said I don't work there and tried to give them back their form, because I literally couldn't do anything with it. They refused to take it back, told me I clearly worked there because I was inspecting the furniture so closely (doesn't everybody closely look at furniture they want to buy?) and to go put their order in the system. I just blankly stared at them, dropped their form on the floor and walked away. 

I honestly had no idea what it was about that day. I have been confused for an employee a few times before but at least those people realized their mistake rather quickly. But five times in one day? That was just weird."

It holds an insight I learned a long time ago, I hope it helps others to avoid having to utter those fateful words this subreddit is named for. 

Standard disclaimers.  First actual post and I'm on mobile.  Also, don't much care about formatting. 

I used to work for a big box home improvement store, in the plumbing department. Probably not the one you're thinking about,  unless you live in the midwest.  I was there on my day off picking up some things for my parents with my employee discount. At the time I was wearing basketball shorts,  an army baseball cap,  and a shirt that read ""let me drop everything and work on your problem.""  In other words not wearing anything uniform related. 

Out of nowhere a customer asked if I worked there. I don't recognize them, so not a regular. On the other hand, I help so many people every day just can't be sure. First instinct is to lie. But, I'm curious. So instead  i answer something like this, ""not today I don't. But if you'll tell me how you knew I will see what I can do."" 

So quickly find out what he needs.  Decide it's something I need to bring him to the paint department for. While we are walking I asked the burning question. His answer, ""you don't look lost.""  Yup that simple. 

Most people are so clueless that anyone who looks confident at all must work there. I've developed the habit of appearing distracted and confused.  Not a single IDWHL since. 

P.S. doesn't always work against Karens. Some people are just too thick or lazy.  But it is a big help."

The first happened about a month ago. I was on shift but had to run to the bathroom, in the store just next door to my station. Wile drying my hands I noticed an old lady talking about the hat she wanted to get. When I say old I mean probably 65+. She stopped when she noticed me. OL: Old Lady. Me: hmmm I wonder...

OL: Oh! Someone who works here!

The second was I think a week ago. I was going off to by some things I needed(manager gave me permission for it was an emergency... women might know what i mean.) Wile on my way back from the section with my stuff in hand I stop to look for a sharpie marker (use them in my gaming book). A woman approached me and I just said hello and kept looking. She said hello back. Since she was still beside me I asked her how she was, figured she was just looking for school stuff. She goes off on a rant for a wile with me half listening wile still looking (they ended up being a different isle.) She then asked me where an item was and I told her I didn't work there, once again pointing put my nametag with logo on it. She says my name and asks again. I tell her again I don't know where that item was, that I didn't work there. She was about to start yelling at me, can tell after a wile in Customer Service when they get like that. I was saved by my coworker, also needing to get something, when  I asked him if he knew where markers are kept. He just did school shopping so he knew. I left with him. Last I saw her she was at the customer service desk demanding both him and I get fired. I waved at her from my spot at front counter when the customer service pointed to our store. She then huffed and left. We then closed 5 mins later so all was good lol. I later apologized to the person at the front counter.

Crispy fried chow mein, shanghai noodles, dried thick chow mein noodles. I saw some dehydrated chow mein for cooking beside the ramen during my earlier search, and pointed out where it was. 

The employee had been helping an elderly lady who wanted to try making an asian style salad with fried chow mein. This became apparent as they continued with the list: ""what about the sesame oil?"" ""And it asks for rice wine vinegar, where can I find that?"" The employee couldn't decide whether they had it in the vinegar aisle. I gave her the alternative of using apple cider or white vinegar.

I had to correct myself with the chow mein noodles after finding out she wanted a salad, and located the fried noodles for her, chasing her down after she had thanked me and walked away. ""Y'know, they should hire you!"" Ma'am, I wish.

Couple days ago, I was bouncing around a local grocery place, just trying to stay within my (limited) budget. I had giant headphones on and a university sweater, so I looked like the furthest thing from an employee. 

I was just grabbing cup noodles when this tiny old lady asked me if I knew where the melting chocolate is. The “I don’t work here” was on the tip of my tongue, but she looked a little anxious and embarrassed when she saw my sweater. I proceeded to show her the baking aisle and was about to go on my merry way when she asked if I knew anything about baking.

Spoiler alert: I don’t. 

What followed was me using my phone (on 2% battery, mind you) to call my mother and interrogate her about melting chocolate for drizzling on biscotti. Together, we picked out a semi-sweet option for her that wasn’t $10. I wished her luck on her biscotti and walked away, trying to think of a way to explain my sudden interest in baking to my mother.

No good deed goes unpunished; my phone died (which had my list on it) after I got off the phone with my mom. 

TLDR; sweet old lady asks for help with baking and I spend ten minutes trying to figure out the differences in melting chocolate."

""Yes, but I can't find it.  Is it in stock?""  I have no idea.  I'd normally say that she could ask a staff member, but with how busy they are, they might take a bit to check.

""Why can't you check?  You helped that other lady.""  Regretfully, I was not wearing the trademarked green short-sleeve shirt with an apple-appearing logo.  I was dishevelled and unshaven in a dark grey long-sleeve shirt, in a line of shopping cart pushers, with a full trolley.

During college, I worked at a retail clothing store we'll call Glurgan Cloutfitters.

As I was shopping, a girl came up to me and asked me if I could check for her size and grab it from the back.

Now, for the record, we weren't required to wear any sort of uniform and there really isn't a dress code, so most of the employees can look like regular people, unless they're wearing a Glurgan Cloutfitters lanyard or had on a walkie. I was neither wearing a lanyard, nor a walkie. As a matter of fact, I was holding a couple things I wanted to buy/try on, whilst looking at my phone and I had a fairly large/obvious purse on that (to me) would suggest I'm also a customer. 

I looked up at her and probably looked a little confused, because she immediately asked after ""do you work here?"" To that I responded ""technically yes, but my store is like 2000 miles away from here, so I can't actually help you here.""

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d99psy/angry_freezer_stalker/,"Angry freezer stalker So in my perusing of this and my other favourite subreddits that make me feel a little better about working in retail, or at least not alone in dealing with the types of customers we all see, I read a few stories about be accosted on breaks etc. So this is my story.

Cast: Me, lowly cashier trying to enjoy a day off; AFS- 4'6"" old lady aka angry freezer stalker; M- Mom and her brief appearance.

This happened a few years ago, but as it's a story I've repeated a few times with co-workers, it's mostly still fresh. 

I was on a day off, the first one I'd had in 10 days, and doing a bit of grocery shopping with M. Rent where we lived was insane so I lived with her and Dad. We had made it around the store and our last stops were bakery and dairy. M heading to dairy while I went to bakery. 

Now, I had been working at that particular store for about a year at that time, and would pretty well work any shift, including being called in. So I was easily recognized by customers.  Mostly it was fine, general friendly conversation, joking about being allowed a day off, typical stuff when you see a regular.

In this particular store, bakery, dairy and frozen foods take up a big chunk of one corner of the store. They had recently been working in the freezer section, but I hadn't paid much attention as it wasn't my department. It was also only one section and wasn't a huge change. Ice cream had moved from one side to beside frozen dinners and frozen fruit were now next to frozen veggies. Nothing had been taken out, to my knowledge nothing was discontinued. Just moved from one side of the aisle to the other.

I was in the farthest corner of the bakery deciding on a flavour of bagel when I here this voice. ""The freezer section is changed."" I turn and look and this little old lady (AFS) is standing there with a basket and her can looking at me with this angry look on her face.

Me: ""Pardon?""

AFS: (getting madder) ""The freezer section is different. They moved the ice cream.""

Me: ""Oh, I didn't realize that,  I haven't been other there yet. I know they were working there a few days ago.""

I grabbed my bagels and bread and headed towards dairy and our shopping buggy.

AFS:(following me) ""They changed the freezer. Why?""

Me: ""I don't know, it probably came from head office.""

I realized M wasn't in the dairy aisle anymore so I set off the find her.

AFS, still following me, still getting angry.

AFS: ""I want to know why they changed the freezer. Now I can't find the ice cream."" 

To get to the dairy aisle you have to walk right through the freezer section. So I looked around, and easily spot the ice cream.

Me: ""Oh, they just moved it to the other side.""

AFS: (still following me as I turn down the coffee and tea aisle) ""But they moved it. Why? I want to know!""

By now I had spotted M and was trying to make a not obvious beeline, hoping that this crazy old lady would get the message before I had to start being rude.

Me: I'm sorry, but I can't answer that. If you go up to Customer Service though they can call a manager for you.

As I placed my items in our buggy she finally seemed to realize I wasn't working that day. She grumbled something and walked away.

Now, to save anyone from asking if I was dressed like I was working, at the time we had a very strict dress code, black dress pants, black shoes, white collared top and bright red vest. I was wearing a flowery sundress and flip flops.

I think in total this lady followed me down at least 3 separate aisles repeatedly saying that the freezer section had changed. Really? I never got that the first 20 times you said it.

I had originally that she was a regular, but I didn't recognize her,  which isn't unusual, and I never saw her after that."

I'm new to Reddit, and this is my first post. I was told this was a good place to put stories and that there is basically a whole different language on here, so please forgive me for any mistakes. I'm not entirely sure how to word things or what Reddit terms to use. So sorry if Karen isn't the correct term for the lady in this story.

Backstory:

This was a little under a year ago. I used to work as a dishwasher at a local restaurant and I wore a bright blue shirt that has the restaurant's name on the front corner, like most company shirts do, and the number, address and name of restaurant on the back, and some old dark blue jeans I had. This does look sort of similar to the manager's uniform at the dollar store I went to. Their uniform is a bright blue shirt with the store name on the front corner and black pants. I live in a very small town and everyone dresses super casual, even the uniforms at the dollar store look really casual. My town is so small that most people work at the towns around us, so there isn't many employees at the dollar store and it's hard to find one if they aren't at the register, and it takes them a few minutes to get to the register when there is a customer waiting. I usually don't mind this because I never shop when I'm in a hurry. I am also a socially awkward person and don't talk to people much, so this encounter was just really strange for me.

The Cast:

Me: me duh

CK:  Confused Karen

&#x200B;

Story:

I just got off my shift at work and decided I wanted to hit up the dollar store for some snacks. I'm one of those people who never get a cart and rarely gets a basket, so I was just carrying around some snacks. The store is super empty, pretty sure I was the only customer in there. Suddenly I hear this lady behind me.

This lady defiantly looked like a soccer mom to me, I don't really know what the ""Karen"" looks like but this lady was somewhere between the ages of 30 and 40, she had a short skirt on and a white tank top, she had a weird sort of bob haircut with some sort of flair to it. It looked like a haircut someone really sassy would have, and she was dirty blonde, I don't know if that plays a role or not in her character. Anyway the exchange roughly went like this:

CK: Excuse me, do you know where (some product) is?

Me: (thinking she just needs help and couldn't find an employee) Um, I think they're that way in the corner aisle (points in the direction of the product)

CK: Thank you! (Runs in the direction I pointed at)

Me: (watches her for a moment and heads to a register after grabbing a couple more things)

As usual for a weekday around noon, the cash register was empty, so I was waiting for an employee to notice me. Just as I was about to ring the little bell to try to get someone's attention, the CK comes zooming around the corner and looks at me kinda funny then laughs a little.

CK: Oh, I've never seen a store with a backwards checkout (she then goes around the counter to the cashier's side and waits for me to ring her up)

Me: (Super confused and staring at this lady) Um... it's not backwards?

CK: (Looks at me really confused) what? then why- (as she's saying that, she's looking around and realizes she's on the wrong side of the register) Oh shit, I'm on the wrong side??? (She then comes around to the correct side just as an employee is coming to check us out)

Me: (Noticed the employee coming and looks at the CK) You can go ahead of me if you want.  (I let her in front of me because she seemed embarrassed and also kind of in a hurry, plus if I just made a mistake like that I'd probably want to go jump off a cliff ASAP)

CK: Oh, really? Thank you (moves ahead of me as I back up and completes her pay and leaves in a hurry)

I then payed for my stuff and left.

The employee didn't really say anything about it, so I guess they didn't see her on the wrong side, or just didn't care?

It was only after this experience all the questions popped up in my head like ""Did she not see me carrying stuff?""  ""Did I really look like an employee there?"" and other questions like that, then after a while it was questions like ""My shirt and pants are covered in bleach spots and food stains, how the heck did she mistake me for an employee there??""

I'm sorry this story is probably pretty boring, but it's been repeating in my head because it was just so awkward for me and I felt like I just had to share it for whatever reason. Also, I'm not entirely sure why I chose to call this lady a ""Karen"" maybe she was a novice Karen and hadn't learned the rules of the Karen Club yet?"

Ruby was basically bed ridden and often napped while she had visitors she also had a sweet tooth and loved her ice cream, if she was sleeping when I brought ice cream for her I had permission to use the fridge in the day room to store this. Visitors could also get themselves a drink there for themselves and those they were visiting.

Ruby's room door had a squeaky hinge ( this plays a role ).

I went to visit Ruby with some ice cream, I signed the visitors book and let myself in with the code, as I was closing the door behind me it was tugged open by the woman in the title, she huffed and nudged past me.

Ruby was sleeping so I put my bag down and went to put the ice cream in the day room. As I passed the next room the door opened and woman looked out, I nodded and went on my way, I chatted to one of the staff about Ruby and returned to her room. 

Not to make this too long over the visit, I popped in and out of Ruby's room a few times to get her ice cream, make her a cup of tea etc. Each time I left the room the woman would pop her head out and scowl at me.

I said goodbye to Ruby at the end of my visit, and as I was signing out the woman left the office and pointed me out to the manager of the home, who looked puzzled, and the woman stormed out.

The manager waited until she left and then burst out laughing.

I love to read them, and have been looking forward to the day I get to share my own. Today is that day folks. It just happened!

To set the scene I run the front desk of a small therapy office, in a small town. My office is attached to a small healthcare office (regular doctor’s office) that also runs as a suboxone clinic. I don’t know much about suboxone, other than it’s used to help individuals get off heroin or another similar type drug. My office and XYZ healthcare are in the same building but are very different companies. It would be like having a game stop and Subway located next door in a strip mall together. 

Me is me, SkyTelle
Ech is the entitled crack head, I would call her Karen but she didn’t look like a typical Karen. Granddaughter of the Karen is possible though. 

My office is open Monday thru Friday 8:00am to 5:00pm. During this time (minus the hour my boss mans my desk so I can take lunch) one can find me perched by my phone and ready to greet anyone whom calls or walks into the office. XYZ healthcare changes their hours every few months so I’ve not bothered to memorize their schedule as it is posted on their front door for all the public to see. Everyday someone will come into my office asking if XYZ HC is open or if I know their hours to which I politely inform them that we are separate corporations, I do not know, however hours and phone number are posted on their door. Usually they say thank you and carry on their day. 

Not today though... 

I’m making my appointment reminder calls for the day and happen to look up as Ech whips into our parking lot, and screeches to a halt, sideways taking up three spaces and blocking others from easily getting around her. It’s a very small parking lot, and her truck is pretty big. As I’ve got no one scheduled for appointments this afternoon I figure it was someone late for an appointment with XYZ HC and go back to my calls. I don’t even get to finish dialing the next number on my list and Ech is at my window banging away angrily. 

Now, on my Window I’ve got a sign posted to please not knock on my window and that we will be with you shortly. As I am on the phone I raise my hand to show that I acknowledge her, and will be with her in one minute. This was not enough, as she proceeds to scream at me through the window. So, I hang up the phone before the person I’m calling answers and hears Ech’s obscenities. 

Me - “How Can I help you today?” 

Ech - more demanding and yelling than asking, “Why is XYZ HC closed at 2:30 today? Did they close early? Are they open”

Me - “I’m sorry miss but I don’t know XYZ’s hours of operation as they are a different company than mine. However, their hours are posted on their door as well as the number to their main office.”

Ech - screeching at me, “I just checked and their door is locked! When are they open?”

Me - “That is unfortunate, but again, they are a different company and you will have to get their hours off of their door.”

At this point Ech has burst into tears and has melted into one of my lobby chairs...
Ech - “Are you saying that nobody can heeeeelllpp Meeee? Why did XYZ HC close early? I neeeeeeed mmmyyyyy mediciiiiine! Why won’t you help me!” - this being the shortened version of her fit, add some fake sobs and some cuss words and you get the gist. 

Me - “I’m sorry for your frustration but again, this is something you need to address with XYZ HC. I work for ABC therapy. You will need to address your concerns with XYZ HC.”

The tears stop. The theatrics stops. Ech has demanded that she speak with my supervisor because she needs to see her doctor. My supervisor happened to be in a meeting, that I was not about to interrupt. But Ech doesn’t know this. 

Me - “Sorry miss, but she’s currently out to lunch. If you’d like to bring it up at XYZ HC though you can go into their main office at blah blah blah, or call them at 1-800-idontworkherelady... they will be more than happy to address your concerns. Would you like me to write it down for you.”

Y’all, she was livid! Ech - “I know where the F*** it is, I’m gonna make sure you won’t be able to work in this town again, etc, etc....” thrashes some chairs around and storms off. 

My supervisor heard the commotion and came to see if I needed help. Upon giving the rundown, she doubled over in laughter over the silliness. Thankfully Ech left before we had to hit the panic button. Though I can’t lie, it would have been have been very exciting.


Edit: My mobile device fails me spelling...

Edit 1.2: I’d like to say that where my choice of words could have been better for the individual in my encounter, I do not take it back. She is a drug addict, who was being a Karen. This does not mean however that I do not have sympathy for individuals who struggle with addiction. It’s a very serious, mental illness. However, I do not sympathize for theatrical displays of attempted manipulation and violence. Boundaries. I gave her everything she needed to help herself, presented in a calm, polite way, and she made unhealthy choices. 

I could have called the police and had her picked up for threatening someone in a health clinic, which is a serious crime. Potentially leading to something worse like a drug charge, but I didn’t. If she really needs her medication she will take the two mile drive to the main clinic of which I provided both address and phone number."

Guy: excuse me, do you know anything about onions?

Guy: if I'm going to cook this (holds up pack of steak and pack of white mushrooms) with mushrooms and onions, which onion should I get? 

Me: oh I like the yellow ones they're a bit sweeter, whereas the white ones are a bit more mild. 

Guy: so yellow then?

Guy: okay thanks! 

He trots off happily with his yellow onion and steak, and I think about how maybe I'm jaded and people are generally better than the isolated stories we read.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d8jnm7/i_dont_work_here_you_do/,"I don't work here You do.  So I was working as a sales promoter while I work at the store I do not work for the store. I work for one of the suppliers giving out samples of Meat and Cheese my company makes. normally I have not problems at the stores but there was this one that was always a pain.

When I come in I cut up some of the of the meats i am sampling in half pound bags for quick sale and then my samples. I never asked anyone to slice for me and always cleaned the slicers before (because the workers never cleaned) and after (they once blamed me for the mess on a slicer I did not use it was their mess). 

I was use to customers calling out to me while I was preparing my samples and explained that I did not work for the store and if I injured myself on the slicers no one would pay for my injuries. What I was not use to was the employes telling me to work the deli counter while I was there. 

They kept telling me ""the other girl does it""

I told them, ""they shouldn't we don't work here if we get hurt we have to pay out of our pocket.""

I tried to get the attention of the employs for the customers but nothing and even had one of their managers come and tell me to slice. 

one of them came up to me, ""why can't you help us out?""

me ""I tried to be nice and help out my first time here and you all stopped coming over at all. I am not paid to slice for the customers I am paid to sample out the food. you are insured through work with workers comp. I am not because I don't work here YOU do. I will not help because you WILL leave to to me and not let me do my actual work.""

They called my manager and told him that I did nothing but chat with customers all day and blamed their mistakes on me. They said that my chatting confused the customers and they did not want me there anymore.

What actually happened is I sampled them out our new roast beef and turkey from our new organic line. since they contain no nitrites and the customer could not have nitrites. They ordered a pound of each and I saw the employee grab the wrong roast beef and tried to correct the employee. They ignored me so I let them cut it but warned the customer to look at the label as the one that the employee grabbed contained nitrites. The customer made sure that they got the proper roast beef and the store had to throw away the first pound.  

My boss believes me since he hired me away from one of the other stores for my work ethic and any ""chatting"" on the job would lead to more sales as they were usually ways to combine our meats cheese and sausages in recipes or sandwiches. He just stopped sending us to that store. Whatever I hated working at that store they kept having me move where I was placed. Also all the other stores I went to loved me, I got sick and had to quit and when ever i go to the stores they call me over to see how i am doing and ask my former coworkers and manager about me while I was too sick to go to the stores went to one 3 days ago and they all came out to hug me since they were not busy at the moment, so he knew it was just one bad store."

Me: me      Karen: K     Supervisor: S
Sandwich shop employee: SE

So it happened. I finally met my first Karen after 19 years. I’ve met many people with the Karen haircut but they’ve all been nice. Not this time. 

So I work at a well known corner shop in the UK. We also happen to have a well known sandwich shop as part of our shop. Now, they have a fancy coffee machine that makes lattes and all the fancy coffee so we all tend to use that to get tea or coffee. Sometimes they’ll offer to make one for us. In the mornings theirs usually only one person on making sandwiches and we always have 2. One supervisor and one sales assistant. Well on this morning I was behind their counter making myself a cup of tea because I hate coffee and I only know how to make tea on the machine, SE was out in the warehouse sorting out their delivery when Karen came in and caught me. I have my back to her minding my own business. 

Now bear in mind our uniforms are completely different. Ours is black with our company name. Theirs is green with a hat with their company name on the front of their shirt in huge letters. 

K: Excuse me
Me: (turns around and smiles) yes hello I’ll be over in just a sec (I assumed she was a customer for my side) 

K: Make me a latte and a cappuccino to go 

Me: oh sorry I’m afraid I can’t do that. I don’t work here

K: but you’re using the machine and are behind the counter so you can just make me my drinks

Me: No I’m sorry I don’t know how to make the drinks you want and I don’t work for “Sandwich shop” I work for “corner shop” look my uniform says so (i point to company logo on my shirt) 

K: I don’t care you’re behind the counter so you can make my drinks 

Me: (getting fed up.  I’m tired and it’s too early to be dealing with this) I was just making myself a cup of tea. If you give me a second I can buzz up SE so she can make your drinks. 

K: NO YOU ARE BEHIND THE COUNTER. DON’T LIE TO ME I SAW YOU USE THE MACHINE SO YOU DO KNOW HOW TO USE IT. YOU’RE JUST BEING DIFFICULT YOU TWAT

Me: Look I’m not lying to you and I don’t appreciate you talking to me like that (I start to walk to the door to go to my side oh the shop with my tea) 

K: DON’T YOU DARE WALK AWAY FROM ME YOU BITCH 

By this point I’ve had enough, so I carry on walking to my side when she grabs my arm making me spill my tea over both of us!! Great. I’ll have to clean that up. I ignore her and keep walking and immediately buzz my supervisor up. Karen’s still having a go at me and screaming about how I threw my tea over her. Luckily S finally heard all the commotion and came over. 

S: what’s the problem here

K: I tried to get some help from this employee here and she ignored me!! When I went to ask her again she threw her drink on me!! Look it’s burnt me (proceeds to show S where the tea landed on her arm) 

Me: WHAT!! That’s not true!! I was making myself a drink and explained to her I couldn’t make her drink for her. When I said that she got all mad and grabbed me making me spill my drink. Go watch the cameras!! 

At this Karen looks a little scared but still kept her story. S goes to look at the cameras and I go back behind the toll to serve other customers. Karen’s stood quietly by the door. I’m surprised she didn’t try and leave. S comes back out and proceeds to BAN KAREN for laying hands on me. She was fuming but ultimately left when S threatened to call the police for assault. I now have the satisfaction of seeing her face plastered on our wall of shame every time I work.

These rack of clothes between us has a couple of 50% sign. I don't know how they missed that but me being a nice guy told them that these racks between us are the 50% clothes.

I was still wearing my gym clothes (shorts & dri-fit shirt) and after they saw that, one of the teenagers frowned and asked me if I work there.

Obviously, I told him I don't work here but happy to help. Then the other teenager told me to f\*ck off.

I don't know why but I found it so funny."

The cast: 
CC = Counter Clerk
NL = Nice Lady, & the real victim of r/IDonmtWorkHereLady
BG = (not “Bad Guy,” tho good guess) Bratty Geriatric
Me = me
SV = Silent Veteran

The events:
I’m visiting my local Mart of Walls, The the automotive section to get new tires for my car. When I arrive at the counter, there’s a young lady (CC) helping another customer (NL) with copying keys. They’re chatting idly, and I join in; pleasant day, simple stuff. After a few minutes of fighting the key-cutting machine, CC is nearly half-way through helping NL and her series of keys, and two other gentlemen have joined the queue. Idle conversation continues, and I make my usual joke of “business at the speed of technology.” 

After what felt like 20 minutes, but according to my watch had been less than 10, I hear the man behind me, hereafter known as BG, speak up: “are you the only one working back here today?” His tone at this point was essentially neutral, neither angry nor pleasant.

CC, apologetically: “yes, sir. The tech are all working on people’s cars, and I’m the only one running the counter.”

To everyone’s surprise, BG slammed down his items and proceeded to walk out in a huff. I remember seeing his red hat with trigger-warning catchphrase and thinking to myself, “great, here’s someone who validates everyone’s negative opinions of that campaign slogan...”

NL, sweet as could be: “have a nice day!”

CC: silent as the grave, trying hard to keep from having a breakdown

SV: quietly waiting & patiently watching the drama unfold — I didn’t yet realize he was a fellow veteran, however 

BG, without bothering to identify the speaker: “You don’t have to be sarcastic!”

NL, over with his childish antics: “F### you!” 

BG, still not bothering to turn around: “You can’t talk to me like that!”

Me: “You’re going to say that to a *customer*?”

Finally, he turns around, anger, confusion, and surprise a nice Neapolitan sundae on his face
BG, more challenging than actually asking: “What?”

Me, gesturing to NL: “You’re going to say *that* to a *customer*? Someone who has no reason to be nice to you, but did anyway?”

NL: “This young lady here is just trying to do her job, your behavior isn’t helping...”

BG started to argue back, when I called him out on his head gear: “Be deserving of that hat on your head.” 

BG: “What’d you say, boi!?”

I finally changed my stance from casual to squared-up, but stayed put: “You want to say that to a Vet?” I figured maybe, just maybe, if he realized who he wasn’t getting angry at an actual veteran and not just some mouthy kid, he might change his tone. Nope. Entitled man-child elder syndrome wins over common decency again.

BG: “I don’t care *who* you are—“

Me, cutting him off mid-tirade: “Clearly. So why don’t you just turn around, go get in your truck, and go run those errands you’re in *such* a hurry to go do. Be *worthy* of that hat on your head.”

Still grumbling indignantly, he did just that. Both NL and I turned back around to CC to make sure she was doing okay, and she quietly mouthed “thank you” to us. As it turned out, that was only the most recent a-hole customer she’d had to deal with that day, but the first time someone had so swiftly and thoroughly come to her defense. Poor thing was silently crying as the emotions settled down. 

Meanwhile, I looked over the gauge the reaction of the final customer in line and realized his shirt indicated he had been deployed to Kosovo back in the day; a fellow Vet who had served the in order to preserve the BG’s right to throw a public tantrum.

All because BG was too self-absorbed to realize someone other than an employee could wish him a nice day, or be genuine, and took his angry entitlement out on a NL who was just trying to cheer up his day.

NL, wherever you are, I hope you keep rocking, no matter where a-holes *think* you work!"

One works at a Walmart and the other works at a grocery store, which is the setting for this story. Speaking of which, on to the story!

I went grocery shopping with my mom (M) last week. As I was waiting for my mother to come back with her cart, an older woman (OW)heads for the door inside and notices me.

OW: I didn’t know you were working today!

Me: I’m not. I don’t work here.

OW: But don’t you work retail?

My mom chimed in, because she noticed I was having trouble. I’m a little on the awkward side when it comes to talking to people.

M: It’s probably one of my other daughters. One of them works here.

OW: I could have sworn she worked at Walmart...

M: my other daughter works at the Walmart in the next town.

OW: Oh! That explains it! Y’all look a lot alike!

We got back to the boat/bus terminal but, due to the biblical rainstorm going on were soaked to the bone despite our rain gear. Once we were in the terminal I quickly realized I was leaving a significant trail of water, so, not wanting to contribute to the inconsiderate American tourist stereotype, I stepped outside under the entrance awning to try and wring as much water out of my clothes as I could.

An important note: at some point before our tour boat returned, a convoy of tour buses had arrived and disgorged a massive group of Japanese tourists

So there I am, in my shorts, leggings, and shirt (with a very prominent image of my university mascot), wringing out my jacket and hat over a storm drain when one of the aforementioned tourists (BM- bus man) approaches me.

BM: \*says something I don't understand due to my single minded focus on winging every last drop of water out of my hat\*

Me, realizing I'm the only non-Japanese person around: Sorry sir, I don't actually work here

BM, increasingly agitated: Where is the bus?

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d7dsp0/team_rocket_is_here_to_make_your_day/,"Team Rocket is here to make your day! So, hi. Just thought I'd post something, I guess, is a 'I don't work here, lady' situation??? I don't know. Just thought to share something that happened just yesterday. If it doesn't belong here feel free to delete it or something, but with what happened I feel as if it sorta fit the bill. Maybe. Probably. First language English and I will not excuse myself for bad spelling and grammar; it'll be my own fault for not properly checking before posting.

Not much dialogue, this is just mainly small stories put together as a summary of a day out.

So a little backstory: right this weekend, starting yesterday on Friday, the 20th of our lord 2019, there's this event being held by Nintendo/Niantic for Pokemon:GO (yes, people still love it go figure right ahahahaha). It's the Pokemon Safari, you buy yourself a ticket, enter a set route by the event holders and basically go to town for 6 whole hours with an upped shiny rate. I mean by the end of the day, my friend who I was accompany wound up with 12 brand new shinies. And several other Pokemon. 

Since my phone decided it no longer wanted to support Pokemon:GO I didn't bother buying myself a ticket for the Safari. However, since my friend was visiting from the States (I'm Canadian btw) to come and enjoy this event, I wanted to accompany him at least 1 hour on the route because apparently any normal people can show up (you just won't have the special catch rates or goodies) and walk around in the Safari Route.

So being unable to play P:GO, to have my own kind of fun, I dressed up in cosplay. (Click [here](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f30cbce63decf1e020fcf90f6a8156e9/8671fdf058703724-e7/s540x810/31eec9d02691a082c289111eefef8c72fa6140d2.jpg) if you want to see the ugly dork that is me) Now I hadn't touched P:GO in a long time so I only recently heard that Team Rocket had been added as a part of the game, so I decided to dress up as a Team Rocket Grunt. My boyfriend also decided he wanted to dress up with me for solidarity and went as a Rocket Admin.

The day was great, the sun was out and the minute I stepped out of the subway station that dropped us off right on the island for the event we were assailed with the P:GO main theme and messages in both French and English telling us where to go. Three colourful banners were waving in the wind majestically, each stamped with the symbol of individual teams of Mystic, Valor and Instinct. And there ahead stood an archway signalling the first steps into the event.

It was all glorious and pumped me up even more despite me having no phone in hand to play. However, this is probably how and why people were confused as we walked in, strutting our stuff. 

While I am, by no means, a professional, when I cosplay I do my best to act the character. My standards are about the same level as any actor you find dressed up in Disneyland/World. I will do whatever I can to not break the illusion. People who knew and understood the whole cosplay scene complimented me and my boyfriend for appearing in full cosplay. For those who were just there for the event...

Now, apparently, there are now Rocket Stops in P:GO and every time my friend from the States needed to stop we were nearly always stopped at a Rocket Stop. And me, being used to people staring, was right 'front and center', playing with a prop pokeball I brought along. People were whispering to each other (mainly mother pushing their prams), wondering if they could approach and words of 'does she work for the event?' could be heard upon the wind. And rather than verbally answering to any of those whispers, I merely raised my eyes, met their gazes and waved. Which caused most of them to scatter and hurry along. I didn't mind this, just giving them all this unreadable smile that could either just be some innocent thing or 'if you get near me I'm going to steal your Pokemon'.

The braver ones were the younglings, actually coming within arm's length before scurrying off to their mother's legs. So close, so far, but when I met their gazes they smiled shyly and hid their faces.

There were of course the fearless photographers who took notice of me and asked me for photos, either as selfies, pictures of friends standing next to me or even a short video of me challengingly thrusting my pokeball forward at the lens. It was a good time and if people wanted photos I was always happy to pose, answer questions in character. Even scare off a few kids, hearing them laugh and shriek as they ran away from Team Rocket. All the while people were thinking I worked for the event/venue. I was always happy and ready to make someone's day a little brighter through cosplay, no matter if I worked for the venue or not. I personally did not want to ruin anyone's fun and I was having fun myself.

Now the one meeting that stood out to me the most was this one young girl who approached my boyfriend and I while we took yet another break/stop after 30 minutes of walking. This time at a spot where you could take selfies with standees of the GO Team Leaders (if you clicked the earlier link to my picture, you'll see what I mean). As usual, people asked for photos of their kids posing with me and my boyfriend.

This girl stood at the back of a small crowd around us and when they got their photos and started to disperse she stood there, as if she really wanted to come, but was too shy. After getting a good look at her, I had a feeling this was not going to be a normal encounter, especially with her mother hovering behind her.

So, like in every other situation where someone was too shy to come, I was extra cheerful and friendly when I looked over at this girl, waved her to come over and say hi to me. The kid was on the spectrum and I could tell all the stimulation of the day was getting to her, but she seemed excited, too. Happy. And her eyes lit up as I met them and gestured her to come talk to us.

And she did. And oh, my heart burst from how cute she was, talking about her day was going during the Safari. Her eyes were sparkling and bright as she rambled about the pokemon she caught and how she loved it. I asked her some questions, the usual stuff about Pokemon, you know. Just simple, easy things anyone can talk about and with no rush to my voice or anything. Just a smile, keeping eye contact and generally being chipper (despite being a dumb and walking around prior to the recent stop for 1 hour already in heels, in heat while wearing all black). For her, I knew this would be a highlight if not THE highlight of her day to see something from this magical virtual world sorta come to life. I don't know her. I don't know her background. But the moment she smiled, it clicked into my head as it always does to make this an experience for her as as any Disney Princess would at Disney World. I ain't no Disney Princess, obviously, but I got standards and a simple stance on the world.

If you can make someone's day brighter, just do it. It honestly made me pleased as peach to do it, and it definitely seemed to make her happy.

We got a picture together. She thanked us and her mom came to talk to us a bit while the kid went around to catch a few more Pokemon. She asked us some questions, other people too, came up to talk to us. But you all know the main question here, which had come up several times during the day.

Of course my answer was,  ""Oh, I don't work here, but I never mind making other people's experiences a little happier and fun."" To which she looked so surprised as did others, but I just shrug and smile. I have fun, they have fun. So it's all harmless fun, isn't it?

The rest of the time was generally the same. More walking, more stops, more photos, more of me doing ridiculous things to make people smile and laugh. And me having dead feet after 3 hours of walking in high heels (cosplay is suffering). 

But yea, that was the main incident that stuck with me yesterday. I hope she caught herself a lot of shiny Pokemon and is having a rocking time. And anyone from here attending, I hope you guys have a great ol' time, too!

Thanks for reading and sorry for the length! I hope you enjoy your day and that this little story maybe lifts your spirits a little. :)

TLDR: Spent all day in Team Rocket cosplay, did my best to make my own and everyone else's day a little more special despite not working for the Pokemon Safari event. It was wholesome.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d75tgd/i_dont_work_there_anymore_figure_it_out_yourself/,"I don't work there anymore, figure it out yourself or call a store with a competent manager TL;DR:  Manager pissed me off, I put in my 2 weeks, then manager had to call me to ask how to handle a party package I'd sold and I got to remind her I didn't work there anymore.

Once upon a time, way back in days of yore, I was a young lad seeking my first legitimate employment after high school.  Seeing as I had only just recently turned 17 (early graduate by 2 years) and lived in a rural area, a lot of options were closed to me.  Sure, I could work under the table like I always had before, but it was time to start working a real job.  So, I hopped in my hand-me-down vehicle, drove the 40 minutes into town, and started putting in job applications.  One of the places I applied was an arcade.  For those of you born after 1995, this was an establishment where you found video games, skeeball, and games of skill and chance which you could play for a fee, an example can be seen in season 2 of Stranger Things.

I was hired at the Arcade by a manager who was about to leave his role as manager to take a better paying job working in a parts manufacturing plant, who had trained his replacement to take over for him.  Cool, cool, except... right after he leaves, replacement gets arrested for simple possession.  Ends up losing his job as well.  No store manager.  Area manager comes in, sees our staff is basically me, a young woman who consistently shows up late and does the bare minimum, and a stoner friend of our former replacement manager.  After what happened with him, Area manager decides he needs to replace the manager with someone else and bring us up to full staff (\~6-7 people, basically) but in the interim will fill in for the manager duties he can, but needs someone to handle the daily manager duties he can't because he's responsible for a bunch of different stores and corporate stuff.  Long story short, I get a crash course in managerial training with what I even then knew was a laughable excuse for a pay raise in compensation, no real authority or position in exchange for a bunch of responsibility.  Time passes, his first candidate to take over the store is a train wreck, he gets a replacement manager by promoting the fully trained Assistant Store Manager (hereafter ASM) of another store on the condition that they get a replacement.  Cue my transfer.

New Store has a kickass manager.  She promotes the younger sister of her former ASM to be her new ASM, (didn't bother me, the company had a policy against letting people under 18 take management roles, and I didn't want it anyway, after my experience I was looking forward to LESS stress and responsibility).  New Store Manager leaves the store when her husband - Air Force - gets transferred to a new duty station.  ASM is now Store Manager.  Doesn't name a new ASM.  ASM dislikes me.  I spend months working there.  I sell a birthday party package - something the company wants us to do as much as possible but that hadn't been done at that store in the entire time ASM had been working there, and apparently no one but me (because we did it ALL the time at other store) knew how to do.  One morning, before opening, I'm going through the opening procedures when ASM AND Area Manager are there.  Things come to a head, Area Manager is there because store is losing money, ASM accuses me of stealing from the store.  I turn to the Area Manager and give my two verbal weeks notice on the spot, say that I am not a thief and refuse to work with someone like ASM after they've accused me of it.

Fast Forward two weeks and one day.  The day of the birthday party.  That I'm the only one at the store who knows our procedures for.  I get a phone call asking if I'll come in and work it.  ""I don't work there.  Remember?""  ""Well, can you at least tell us how we're supposed to do this?""  ""Try calling another store, one with a COMPETENT manager, for advice.  I'm not obligated to help you since I do not work there anymore.""  She started to raise her voice but I hung up and didn't answer her callback.

Edit:  Wow, I didn't expect this many responses.   Since tone doesn't carry well over the internet and the fact that I was being mildly facetious when I acted as if no one born after 95 knows what an arcade is, I would like to make clear that was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, making fun of the whole ""only 90's kids"" schtick rather than taking a jab at younger people.  Unfortunately, the internet doesn't always convey tone well, and so it seems that wasn't clear, so I apologize.  I am aware arcades still exist - though I will say that it's my impression more rural ones seem to have died out mostly in the wake of consoles - and that younger people know what they are.  Hell, I've lived in Japan, where they still have multiple story arcades.

As for the timeline, I don't want to get too specific because identifying information and everything, but I was born during the middle of the Reagan administration and was 17 when this happened. Home consoles were already a thing, though gaming wasn't mainstream yet the way it is now. And at least in my rural area, 56k was still the standard unless you were wealthy.

For those pointing out theft =/= losing money, you're correct. Our machines had counters to report the number of tokens that had passed through them, and that would be compared to the number of tokens that had been sold by the coin exchange machine every week at collection by the management. (I did it at the previous store) The numbers never matched, for several reasons, but they were not expected to.

FWIW: I found out months later from a former coworker it was theft.  I just had absolutely nothing to do with it, the discovery, or any of the fallout. By that time, I was getting ready to start college."

Last week, my archery lessons started again after the summer vacation in the small club I go to every Saturday.

This club is held in a gymnasium that shares its schedule with the karate club that obviously take place in the building's dojo while the archery club take place on the basketball court (we had our own building before but this one being constantly occupied by competitions, weekly lessons for ""children"" have been moved to this gym for 4 years now, there's literally too much adult training for professional competition to the point that kids can't train anymore. I guess moving the opened hours a bit was too hard since we have our lesson from 10am to 11:30am so it's not that long anyway).

In short, the janitor had just arrived, and while he turned off the alarm and opened all the doors inside, I was holding the front door for everyone to enter (the instructors were late so this was my way of waiting for them to arrive).

Now, one thing to be aware of is that I am the only student to legally be an adult, the second oldest student is 15 years old while I will be 19 next month. Certainly I sometimes take care of other students but my level of responsibility towards them stops at the difference of age (weird way of saying this I know). I am only the oldest and I assume the consequences of being the oldest.

Knowing this, a father started to approach me, shaking my hand, introducing me to his son and telling me they had written him down for a year and wondering if there were any papers to be signed among other things.

I was mistaken with an instructor. So I told this father that I am not a monitor and they are late but he will only repeat what he just told me.

^(I mean sure, the instructor asked me if I was interrested in becoming an instructor myself but still...)"

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d72gtl/brown_skin_orange_bikini_poolside_attendant/,"Brown skin + orange bikini = poolside attendant This happened a couple months ago on a vacation to a popular US sunny destination. I was with my partner’s family (they are white) and I am a brown skinned Latin American woman (English is my 2nd language but I am fluent in both). We were staying in their timeshare resort, first couple hours since arrival. My MIL and I had just enjoyed a couple delectable cocktails and we (MIL, FIL, partner, and I) had decided to head down to the hot tub after the sun had set. I was wearing a highlighter orange bikini, with a black fishnet-looking coverup, and bare feet (flip flops in a tote bag), my hair up in a clip. I looked flushed and a little sunburnt, no makeup on. We settled in a hot tub but I felt a little too warm after a while so I got out to explore. I was walking around the pool and looked out of a balcony onto the pool and hot tub below, then was about to lap around and back into the hot tub when an older man (OM) sitting on a pool chair started speaking to me. 

OM: mumbles something but I cannot hear him because the wind is in my face and he’s speaking quietly. 

Me: “excuse me?”

OM: “Just sitting here for a little, not swimming, just hanging out, I won’t make trouble” 

Me: (thinking the guy is being flirty or friendly) *laughs* *tries to turn around to the safety of my family* “sounds good!”

OM: “so is it ok? Can I sit here?”

Me: (still not understanding but thinking the guy is being weird and feeling uncomfortable) “sure, you go ahead and enjoy!”

OM: “just let me know when I have to go, I’ll be good and listen!”

Me: (terrified this guy now wants me to do something to him) *starts backing away and hoping my family is looking my way* [of course perfect timing for my FIL and partner to take off to unknown parts, leaving MIL alone and facing away from me] *smile nervously* 

Suddenly it dawns on me...

Me: “Wait, do you think I work here?” 

OM: *looks puzzled* “yeah, don’t you?”

I look around quickly and it dawns on me that I’m the only non white guest in the area, and all the attendants and lifeguards are black or brown people. I tend to be pretty perceptive of where I am, but as I mentioned, I was with family, had drank a few cocktails, and felt safe near my partner, so I didn’t take my usual care to notice the environment. 

OM: continues to go on about how “you look like you work here” etc 

Me: *looks down at above mentioned outfit, pointedly looks at the lifeguard dressed in bright red shorts and white t-shirt* “no, I’m on vacation with my in-laws”. 

OM: “well... you just have an air of authority!!!” *turning redder and continuing to backpedal, can’t remember what he said but he was clearly embarrassed* 

Me: “Ok!” *turns around and hurries back for MIL, who hasn’t even noticed anything happened. I tell her the story, we laugh it off, and from that moment till check out I avoid wandering around by myself.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d76t89/well_technically_he_did_work_there_just_not_how_i/,"Well technically he did work there, just not how I thought A few days ago I posted a story of when I mistook someone for a store employee, it was well received so I thought I'd share another one of my IDonTWorkHere mistakes...

I work in film and television as a set dresser. Basically my job is to put everything you see into the set, the couches tables, lamps, picture all the nicks and nacks on the shelves the drapes on the windows, we even put in the (fake) light switches. Basically if what you're seeing on the screen is not costumes, props or makeup, a set dresser is probably the one responsible for putting it there.

Now to understand this story I first have to explain how the electricity works on a set on a sound stage. In your home when you need to plug something in you just plug it into a wall outlet, but on a set the walls are fake (they are just simple frames made out of 1x3 and sheeted a layer of luan of really thin plywood). Over the course of a show sets are routinely  torn down, rebuild, or changed. In short everything it temporary so we don't hardwire up electricity they way you would in a permanent building. Instead behind the scenes, off camera, is yard and yards of cable carrying the power to where it needs to be. High amperage cables take power to distro boxes which in turn go to junction boxes (lunch boxes we call them), where everything is plugged in with a standard outlet plug. This allows for power to be quickly moved to where it needs to be when they need to place a light somewhere for a shot, and move it out of the way for the next one.

It's also worth pointing out that my job as a set dresser means I'm not usually around when the actual filming of the scenes take place. Our job is to dress and prepare the set before they are filmed so they are ready to go for the shooting crew, then when the filming is done we come in to wrap the sets and reset them for the next days filming. As a result we don't have much interaction with the shooting crew and don't always get to know all the people who work on that part of the crew that well.

Anyway, I hope that is a good enough explainer so onto my story...

My day starts out like normal, we start work a few hours before the shooting crew to get the sets ready for the days filming. We reset the sets from the previous days shooting, putting back anything that had been moved out of place and give the sets a quick clean and vacuum. And for one of that days scenes we also had to put up different curtains on one of the sets. The curtains we put up were brand new and so they had creases in them from being in the packaging and needed to be steamed to remove them so they don't look like brand new curtains.

At this point the shooting company is starting to trickle in to begin their day and the filming lights on the stage have been powered up. As a general rule on a film set it a good idea to check before plugging anything high wattage into the set power so you don't overload the circuit and blow a fuse, and since the high power set lights had already been turned on, I did the right thing and asked before I plugged the steamer in.

I see another crew member nearby, I don't remember what it was that made think he was an electrician, perhaps it was something he was doing, or perhaps I was mistaking him for someone else (like I said we don't always get to interact that much with the shooting crew) but I call out to him, ""Is it ok if I plug in this steamer here?""

He answers, ""Sure I don't see a problem with that."" and then as I'm about to plug it in, ""but I'm the sound guy, what do I know? You should probably ask an electrician!""

Like I said in the title, he technically did work here."

It was such a funny incident that I remember it pretty well.

I was at walmart with my mom (before it had the grocery attached to it), and was wandering the aisles looking for an employee to help us out with something. I think it was regarding fabric? I can't remember exactly, but I am pretty sure they still sold fabrics at that time.

Anyway I have my housekeys around my neck, and I'm wearing a t-shirt and pants, iirc. A lady calls out ""excuse me"" and I don't realize she's talking to me. I guess she walked a bit faster to catch up to me because I hear ""excuse me"" again, but closer.

L is the lady, Me is me.

At about 2pm today while checking out with a massive clearance candy haul. I may or may not have spent 40 dollars on chocolate Twix @75 cents each... No shame.

I asked her am important question. English is my first language, I'm on PC {finally so i'm new to formatting} no TLDR. read the post lazy ass lol. Also my Grammar when not assisted by auto correct is just bad so sorry about that. its just how i talk. 

This literally just happened and I'm still confused. I'm one of those people that like to do their pre shopping to budget things out the day before i get paid. I'm also one of those people that like to dress like i'm a rejected hot topic employee that got a job at the local comic book store instead. i in no way look like i work at a grocery store when i'm dressed in what i consider casual clothes. for example today i'm wearing a grey tank top that says ""lets get red and white wasted"" on it {i'm Canadian and i got it for Canada day because beer} blue boot cut jeans, steel toed shows, and a star wars empire beanie. there is also my massive attack on titan man purse and very visible tattoos.

So i was at stupid store today making a list of what i would need for the week. I had my headphones in listening to some j-pop  and metal while i walk around with a calculator and note book in hand. budgeting is important people. I wasn't expecting anyone to bother me today so i was just bobbing along doing my thing looking at meats in the deli. I guess the deli wasn't busy so there wasn't a visible worker anywhere. i didn't mind, i didn't need anyone to help at that very moment and they have a call button if they were needed. I'm standing there writing down the price per gram of some Black pepper garlic sausage when i have a headphone ripped out of my ear violently, and i'm suddenly being screamed at. 

I'm now pissed and wheel around to see a mini soccer mom with way to much perfume on berating me.

cast. Me = Meat Popsicle. EW = Evil Wench. DM = Deli manager. 

EW. ""HOW DARE YOU IGNORE ME YOU LITTLE SHIT! I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION FOR 15 MINUTES! I DEMA-""  

Me cutting her off pissed. ""First off don't ever touch my headphones. its beyond rude. second what in the bloody hell do you want so bad that you felt it was OK to walk up and assault a stranger in a grocery store?"" 

EW blinking in confusion before doubling down on her stupidity. ""What i want is some damn service! And you are the only one here. go get me some smoked ham now before i call for a manager and get your ass fired!""

Me. ""What makes you think you can actually get anyone fired? what makes you think that you are so important that just on your say so you can ruin someones life and take away their paycheck? And what in the hell makes you think i work here?""

Small background. if you look at some of my post history {ignore my attempts to be deep on shower thoughts} you will see i work in retail at liquor stores. and on behalf of all retail workers what EW said next is just wrong. No. The customer is not always right. they are more often then not wrong. 

EW ""Because the customer is always right that's why now do your job!""

Me. ""No. They are not. They are almost always wrong because they have no idea what they are talking about past their own wants! now i'm going to say this slow because you obviously are half blind and more then a little stupid. I. DO. NO. WORK. HERE. AGAIN. LOOK. AT ME.""

All of this attracted a wild deli manager. his appearance wasn't very effective though as EW was still attempting to get me to go behind the counter to use slicers i have no idea how to use. He piped up while the tiny terror was mid rant.

DM. ""What seems to be the issue here?""

EW. ""Finally someone important! i demand this little shit be fired and that you give me my ham free of charge because of his incompetence!""

I just stood there looking annoyed waiting for what i figured was about to happen to happen tapping my toe and looking at the DM.

DM.""Ma'am he doesn't work here. hes shopping just like you.""

Me.""I already told her that but her skull is to thick for it to get through"" yeah i sound rude but this wench interrupted my music and it was one of my favorite songs. Love me some ClariS. 

EW FINALLY looks at me and really takes in my appearance. you can see that the wheel is turning but i guess the hamster is dead because she again demands me to be fired. this time with less conviction as shes still trying to wrap her brain around how a random nerd is not actually a deli worker and might actually just be another customer. 

DM. ""Again he isn't an employee. i cant fire him. and whats more i cant just fire someone because one customer said so. that's not how jobs work.""

EW sounding much less sure of herself. ""But the customer is always right?""

Me. ""Well then you are a paradox because you are very much wrong here. I don't work here i'm shopping. and your lucky i don't call the RCMP and press assault charges against you. next time don't go up to a stranger, worker or not, and rip out their headphones. and if you want help do everyone a favor before flying off they deep end and ACTUALLY LOOK AROUND BEFORE ACCOSTING SOME RANDOM PERSON IN SELFISH INDIGNATION!""

 At that i just walked out and went home. No idea what happened and honestly i don't care. I'm going to go mod skyrim now and have a beer. thanks for reading. and before people call into question how i talk as I've noticed that's a thing on my posts. its just how i am take it or leave it."

This happened a few years ago when I was living in Denver working as a security guard. There was this massive blizzard that just shut the whole town down for a couple days. There was 3ish feet of snow on the ground and I drove a Toyota Yaris so there was no way I was going to make it into work. 

I called up my security company and they said they would send out one of their rovers that was driving a pickup truck with chains to pick me up and take me to work. I was pretty bummed that I wasn't going to get a snow day, but I needed the money so I agreed. We decided the driver would meet me at a busy intersection so he wouldn't have to navigate the side streets since most of them weren't yet plowed. 

I bundled up and headed out. It took 15-20 minutes to get there and then I waited on the corner. It was a ghost town and there were no cars on the road as even the main street had not been plowed. 

There was a little car in the street that someone obviously abandoned after getting stuck. About 20 minutes into my wait, this little Suzuki Samurai came plowing down the street and had to stop at the little abondoned car. 

Once stopped, it was also stuck. I could see Karen getting frustrated and the wheels kept on spinning. She got out of the car and said ""why would you think your shitty little car could make it through this snow?"" She obviously thought the car was mine. I told her the car wasn't mine, but she continued to berate me calling me an idiot. 

She took a shovel out of the back of her Suzuki and shoveled a space in front of the tires. She got back in the car and began to rock the car back and forth. She had a little success, but it wasn't enough because she was trying to do this while sitting in the car.. She needed help...

After 5-10 minutes of this, she asked me to help her. After she treated me like shit I just started laughing at her. She yelled ""FUCK YOU"" right as my ride pulled up. He asked me if she needed a ride and I said she's fine, let's go and we left Karen there. To this day I've never seen a scowl like that as we drove by her.

This happened about a year or two ago. I use to live in a community that sometimes one could get signed up for events that a group of people would go on together. And during the Halloween season several of us wanted to go on a hayride. As it was my last year before I moved out I decided to go too. So myself and a handful of people went to this hayride. Though I am not close to any of them.

Upon getting there it is a pretty normal trip. We had a group leader who was in charge of tickets. We had someone in charge of snacks and such. And somehow I ended up being in charge of calming people down if they got too scared. There was this one girl whom lived next door to me and wanted to go, but was a huge chicken so she was already clutching my arm scared. I would pat her head and say soothing things and pretty much explain what all the scary things were or pretty much deny they were there for her. This calmed her down but yeah she was still clutching my arm. This continued onto the hayride.

I was trying to calm her down as she was already spooked and complimented her for trying so hard to learn about something new (seriously this girl had no clue about hayrides and wanted to know because people kept raving about them) . She only stopped when we saw a young woman and man get onto the hayride with children that were clearly too young for it. For crying out loud she was breast feeding the smallest one while we waited for the ride to start.

The family sat next to me near the front of the hayride. This was a tactic seating since less scariers stick around the front part, yes you get scared first but if you have a good eye you can spot the scares before they happened. So I looked at the small children and said ""Hello, how old are you two? are you excited? do you watch horror?"" I asked trying to gauge their possible fear level. Since what scared me more was if I was gonna be with constant screamers.

The girls smiled. ""I am 5."" said the smaller of the two first

""I am 8. Mommy said we were strong kids."" said the bigger of the two. The mother and father were not paying attention to their kids at all and were talking about the ride to each other.

I sighed knowing I was gonna not have a fun ride. I already had to calm down one person, I was now worried I would have to calm down more. My neighbor clung to my arm whispering her fears in my ears as the hayride shook about going down the path. We came to the person whom told us about the ride and it's rules. I felt small hands creeping onto my other arm and one of my legs. I sighed, This was my fate. Nothing scary yet and now three people were clinging to me scare. Why? I don't know. I explained to them that person was not gonna do anything to them.

After the introduction the hayride really started. Whoosh! Flames from the first scare part. A trio of screams as I became sandwiched between 3 people clinging to me as they screamed. I reassured them. And sighed. The 8 year old was clinging my arm. ""Excuse me, if you are gonna cling to me, can I have my one arm free? You can grab my  waist or my jacket or even my leg. I need to be able to signal that you are too scared to scare to the staff if you or the others are. I would tell her, but she hasn't let go even when I did tell her."" I said to the kid. The girl grabbed the waist band of my jacket and curled up under my arm as her sister now climbed onto my lap hiding her face in my chest.

I waved to the parents. ""Your children are scared, want to do something about it?"" I called over to them. I did this a few times during the calmer moments but when there were scares I was calming down the three females clinging to me. Two of which were kids that I didn't know and my full grown adult neighbor. The parents ignored me each time I tried to get their attention, so I gave up after a while and focused on the fact that the girls clinging to me were terrified. I did each of my tricks to calm down the trio. I spoke kindly and softly, I explained things and even told them when not to look. When scariers jumped onto the hayride I would give them the no scare signal which I had asked one of the ride operators about before hand. They were very nice and understanding. I even acted scared with them so they didn't feel foolish. Got to say it was exhausting and not fun.

The hayride ended after an hour or so, Not sure. it felt like forever to me. The people started to get off. That was when the parents noticed their kids at last. ""Kids, you can let go of the worker. The hayride is done. Did you have fun with the nice scaremaster lady?"" said the father. The girls let me go and thanked me.

""excuse me? What? I don't work here."" I said but the father and mother were not listening. they were already walking off with their kids whom were waving bye to me. I had no idea what they were thinking. I struggled to get off as my neighbor was still clinging onto me crying. Not sure how she was more scared than the kids and was still scare. And employee asked me how the ride was as I got off. ""Apparently I work here, so it sucked. I didn't get to enjoy it at all thanks to...."" I started

""Glad you had a great time."" said the employee before they went to ask another person what they thought.

I and my neighbor rejoined the group from before. ""Didn't know you were meeting friends. you should have told us."" said the leader of the group.

""I wasn't. they thought I worked here. can we go home now?"" I asked more tired than I should have been. When I got home I found marks on my arms, legs and torso from the trio clinging to me too hard. In the end no one really listened to me and I didn't get to enjoy anything. So yeah next time I am going with a friend only.

Edit note: some people were confused about the breastfeeding. The parents had 3 kids.  The 8 year old, the 5 year old, and the baby that never left the mother's arms. I guess I am not good at describing things."

I, being a lazy teenager left alone at home, decided to go buy some food from the fish and chip shop and was waiting for my order when an old man comes in. He picks up his order and turns and sees me.

OM: ""Do you understand English?""


Me: (too quietly) uhh yeah yeah I do-


OM: ""I. JUST. BEEN. TO. YOUR. SHOP.   GOOD. CHOW. MEIN.   VERY YUMMY""


He then leaves with his food, leaving me still baffled and the cashier looking sympathetic. I was both too baffled and polite to come up with any funny or sassy retorts unfortunately.

And also here's the obligatory excuse since english is not my primary language (kinda important for this one).

I live in Rio de Janeiro and had to sort some business downtown, and I already making my way back home when I get approached by what I assumed was an american tourist (I think he must be american mostly because of his accent and how incredibly loud he was).

Here's the cast:

ET - not the alien, just an Entitled Tourist

Me: Molasses Entity i.e. myself

ET: HEY YOU, KID! I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE HOTEL. DRIVE ME BACK THERE NOW.

Me: (noticing he was a tourist) I don't work for any hotels, and it's quite dangerous to ask strangers o the streets of a foreign country to take you anywhere. There's an information counter in this building where they may help you.

ET: NO, I KNOW YOU WORK FOR THE (redacted) HOTEL. AND I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD IF DON'T TAKE ME BACK THERE THIS INSTANT.

Me: Sorry, but I already said I don't work for any hotels or for you you, excuse me.

&#x200B;

I made my way to the metro station only to find out that the tourist followed me there and he was MAD. I sprinted to the turnstile, used my pass to get through it, and stopped to watch what happened to the tourist from the other side. He stopped chasing me right after I got though the turnstile, and was gesturing obscenities at me, and while he was doing so, he left his backpack on the floor. Then in a godly act of instant karma, someone stole his backpack. I burst out laughing and get on the train and make my way home without any other incidents.

She says, “can you take this please?” In the moment I hesitated, I could see her instant irritation. So, for shits and giggles, I took it and placed it on the cart of an actual employee passing by and returned to my seat. By now, my daughter, husband and I are all giggling. The kind that you can’t stop. It was obvious that because I was Asian, she assumed I worked there, which I picked up on as soon as she handed me her tray.

I work nights at a hotel. Most of my shift, I’m sitting at the desk killing time. I’m supposed to be writing, but we won’t discuss that now. 

Anyway, there is one twenty minute period where I have to leave the desk to set up breakfast. I put up a sign asking guests to please wait for me to return. 

As I was working on getting things set up, a guy wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and flip flops comes up and asks me to check something about his reservation. I politely ask him to wait until I finish getting things set up. He agrees and stands at the desk waiting patiently. I go back into the kitchen to work on things. 

As I’m in there, I start hearing a screeching coming from the desk area. I peek my head out to see what’s going on, only to find our hero being accosted by a wild Karen. I couldn’t make out what her problem was because she had already progressed to berating him about doing his job etc. 

Now I should mention that we have a semi lax dress code. Think business casual. We are issued company polos, but it’s our choice whether or not we wear them as long as we look nice. I always wear the company polo to avoid wearing out my personal clothes. Our leeway doesn’t extend to shorts and flip flops, however. 

I also don’t make it a habit of hanging out on the wrong side of the desk. 

I pipe in, “Ma’am, I will be with you as soon as I finish with breakfast. It should only be a few more minutes, but I have to get everything out by 6.”

To her credit, she pauses, looks at how I’m dressed compared to the other guy’s tourist uniform, gets red in the face and storms off without another word. No apology to the other guest of course. 

I didn’t see her again. I’m guessing she was too embarrassed. 

Not the most exciting story, I know, but I thought I’d post it anyway."

I used to be a mail carrier, but as a rural carrier (never mind the fact that most of my delivery area wasn't actually ""rural""), I didn't have to wear a uniform.

One day, my boss sent me to the UPS store to pick up the outgoing mail and packages. Since it was around Christmas time, there was quite a bit, so I borrowed a dolly from the store to help load everything onto my truck.

After I unloaded my first load onto the truck, a random customer saw my empty dolly and asked if I could use it. I tried explaining that, no, it was not my personal dolly and was not mine to give away since I did not work there. (I didn't want to be on the hook in case he ran off with it, and didn't want to stand around waiting for him to return it... not to mention I still needed it.) He did not accept that answer and kept arguing with me when I tried to explain several time that it wasn't mine to give away.

He started following me into the store and yelling about how I was racist for not letting him use the dolly, right in front of staff and other customers. The staff at the store didn't say a word, which kind of pissed me off.

When I got back to the office, I filled out an official incident report just to cover myself in case he tried reporting me for something stupid. My boss, who was the same race as the angry man, asked me what had happened, and I explained. She just said, ""People are stupid."""

Except she didn't have anything with her. Anyway we just said no thank you and moved on.

""I don't work here""

Now at this store the regular employees wear red polo shirts and the managers wear black button downs and red ties. So as I'm walking around looking for my item I see a gentleman in a black button down, a red tie, and a landyard and badge around his neck no less! So I ask him, ""excuse me, can you tell me where XXX is?"" He tells me,""sorry I don't work here.""

Now obviously he does work there because he is coincidentally wearing clothing similar to that off the staff at the store. Thanks to this sub I knew just how to handle this situation. I of course began be screaming at him and calling him lazy and told him I'm going to his manager to have him fired!

No, not really, I instead casually apologized, explained why because of his attire I thought he did work here but now realize my mistake. We both had a slight chuckle and each went on with our day.

I was meaning to post this story for a while but kept forgetting so here. Idk if this is tales from retail or a Idontworkherelady. 

Some back story, at my store there's a certain tall goth woman who comes in only at night. She's very gorgeous and she was dressed in short shorts and a tank top that showed her tattoos. she's very pale and has sleeves and a few calf tattoos. she's never worked at my store and she never bothers anyone except to ask for help. She'll be GC for goth chick.

So she comes in around 6:24 which means there's still sun outside and still warm. I greet her and we talk for a second. I ask her why she's out during the day and she explained that she ran out of tampons and she needed more. I point the aisle out and we part ways. 

I try to cut down the cart full of go backs. I was about three aisles away from the feminine hygiene aisle when I heard yelling. I thought it was another crazy customer who came in and threw shit around so I quickly ran with the cart to the aisle. 

It was GC and a older man who'll be Asshole. 

GC's arm was being grabbed by Asshole who was berating GC for not helping him when he asked. GC was trying to tell Asshole off and yank her arm away. I went up and asked GC what happened, ignoring Asshole. She explained that she was just trying to put some packages of pads she knocked over up and Asshole had asked her where a item was and how she didn't work. 

I asked Asshole to let GC go and that she didn't work here. He got mad and gripped her arm tighter before unleashing a rant of how GC should be fired and demanded that I get the manager. I was tired so I didn't really give a shit and told Asshole to let go of GC and that she doesn't work here. 

Yeah that was a mistake. 

Asshole screamed how ""I was the worst employee here and that GC was a whore for dressing like that in the workforce."" I told Asshole to pay for his items and leave. He refused and said he wouldn't leave until he saw the manager and to see ""this stupid little girl"" be fired. 

I lost the one remaining fuck I gave and told Asshole to just leave GC alone and that I'm going to get the security guard now. Asshole then dropped his hand basket full of items onto the floor and stormed out. He ranted and raved that ""everyone is stupid and that dumb sluts like them (GC and me) shouldn't be working and in the kitchen."" 

I didn't know how to react so I turned and asked GC if she was okay. She said she was and just hated people like that shithead and wanted to go home. I got her a cold water from the break room and walked her up front. I got my manager who's a great woman and explained everything to her. GC showed my manager the bruise. the security guard came over but didn't do much since he was just a random guy. 

We didn't call the cops but decided to file a report and have the guy 86'ed. I walked GC out to her car and told her to have a good night and apologized for Asshole.

My manager told me that I handled the situation well but I dont know. The rest of the shift was pretty uneventful but I still can't help but feel awful for GC having to deal with Asshole's abuse.

Edit: Holy shit! silver! thanks!! I'll clear up a few questions. 

86'sed means banned. Idk why I used that term but hey you understand. 

No we didn't call the cops because GC asked us not to. I haven't seen her lately in the store so I can't really give any update. Maybe she went to the cops on her own time, maybe she just let it go. 

Yeah it was assault. No I don't know why Asshole was in feminine hygiene."

A brief background, I’m middle eastern who live in the United Arab Emirates in the capital of Abu Dhabi. I’m a local but I don’t look it as my mother is from Egypt, and I would get mistaken for other nationalities often.

On to the story: My niece got a new pet about a month ago from one of her friends, a 5 month old german shepherd, and she’s the cutest thing ever imo. Unfortunately, the friend didn’t bring enough food for the puppy, so I went the next day to a hypermarket nearby to buy some for her. I was told she liked a particular brand, so I decided to go inside without a cart or basket to see if they had it, then go back out for a cart. 

On my way to the pet food isle I heard shouting and yelling from close by and out of curiosity I went to check it out. I saw one of the workers and a wild Karen. While she didn’t LOOK like a Karen, she sure as hell ACTED like one, screaming at the poor guy about how “incompetent and rude he is”, and “ignoring her when she was trying to get his attention”, and of course, she was yelling for a manager. 

That’s when she turned around and locked eyes with ME, and made a beeline to where I was. Now keep in mind the workers uniform is a yellow or light blue shirt with the hypermarket name on it in big letters, and the managers wear full suits, I was wearing black jeans and a dark blue shirt. Also, majority of the staff were either from India or the Philippines. 

Now for the cast
OL: obnoxious lady, PW: poor worker, M: manager, Me: yours truly.

OL: You, manager, this employee of yours was very rude to me, he ignored me when I was trying to get his attention for 10 minutes and is refusing to help me and yelled at me, I want him FIRED.

The first thought that came to mind was to tell her that I didn’t work there, but after seeing the condition PW was in, I decided to have some fun. Now my English has a good American accent, but I also have a fairly decent Indian accent, so without hesitation I switched my accent to Indian mode.

Me: I’m so sorry madam, we’ve had many complaints about this problem worker, don’t worry, I will discipline him. And as a form of apology, please go about your shopping and at the cashier, just give them my name, Roger Patel, and tell them I approved a 40% discount on the total sum for you. OL: At least management knows how to treat PAYING customers.

I went to PW, grabbed his arm and started walking away, “berating” him along the way until we made a turn and we were out of sight of OL, that’s when the PW said: Am I in trouble? It seems PW was new and also mistook me for a manager, and he thought he was going to be fired (poor guy). Me(laughing): I’m not a manager and you’re not in any trouble, I just wanted to get you away from her. And I walked away waving goodbye at him. I grabbed a cart, and went on to buy my puppy her chow and some other things for her (some toys, a new collar, a leash and a comfy bed), and some other items for myself.

After I grabbed what I needed I made my way to the cashier, that’s when I heard a familiar screaming and yelling, and sure enough there was OL, arguing with one of the cashiers and an actual manager, trying to convince them that she was allowed the huge discount on all her items (a full carts worth), while I was laughing on the inside. Then she spotted me, pointed at me and yelled, OL: That’s him, that’s Roger Patel, the manager who approved my discount.

The manager and cashier both looked at me with confusion in their eyes, and the manager said, M: Ma’am, this gentleman doesn’t work here. OL: Yes he does, why else would he give me the discount? He was even disciplining one of your workers. M and OL made their way to me, and I acted like I didn’t know what was going on.

M, pointing at OL: Excuse me sir, do you know this lady? Me, switching on my American accent: Umm, no, I’ve never seen this woman before. OL: You’re lying, I talked to you about that lazy rude worker of yours, and you gave the discount as an apology.
Me: Lady, do I look like I work here? I’m a customer, just like you.

 It was at that moment PW walked by, OL pointed at him and said: There, that’s the worker that I complained about to this manager. M called PW over and asked him: Have you seen the gentleman as the lady before? PW looked at me and OL, and said: No sir, I haven’t. OL: Don’t lie, I was talking to you 30 minutes ago when you refused to help me. PW: Madam, this the first time I’m seeing you or this gentleman, maybe you have me confused with another worker. M nodded and told PW to go back to his work, and as PW walked away he looked at me with a smile and a thumbs up ( which on one saw) . 

OL was fuming with a face that was redder than a ripe tomato. I turned to M. Me: Sir, you’re obviously wearing a suit like all the other managers working here, and I’m wearing casual, who in their right mind would confuse a customer with a worker or manager? M (in an agreeing nod): Sorry to disturb you sir, have a nice day. I nodded back, paid for my items and walked away, with OL still screaming and cussing until M ended up calling security to escort her out of the building, and I went home with the puppy chow, the rest of her stuff and biggest grin on my face.[my doggo ](https://imgur.com/gallery/mCflqXP)[puppy ](https://i.imgur.com/NyPvMjG.jpg)"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d5s8ca/keys_on_carabiner_manager/,"Keys on carabiner =/= manager In my last two years of high school, I worked at Barnes & Noble and loved the hell out of that job. I had to leave it because college was over two hours away. But when I visited the folks, I made sure to stop by the store to see former coworkers and maybe buy something because I have a lifelong book addiction. 

(Common joke was that I didn't get paid; I just ran up a tab. :3)

FYI this happened 20 years ago so I don't remember the fine details. I'll do my best to get the feel of the situation across here.

For the visit to the store that is the reason for this post, I wore a t-shirt, blue jeans, and sneakers. I also had a mess of keys and keychains I wore on a carabiner hooked into the belt loop of my jeans. The keys hung openly because they couldn't fit into my pocket. My friends, all of whom wore business casual with nametags on lanyards (including managers), were helping customers so I decided to occupy my time with straightening endcaps since customers enjoy wrecking them. 

Someone off to my side is trying to get an employee's attention, so I don't pay much mind. After the endcap's spiffy again, I stand up to find a woman right in my face. She wants something in the non-fiction area. I am a helpful person, so my short ass goes on tippy-toe to try and spot the general section before I tell her where she could probably find it.

Her: *most condescending tone* ""Aren't you going to show me where it is?""

SOP was to look up a book in the system and if we had it, walk the customer to the book.

Me: *still wearing casual, nametag-free clothing* ""Nope! I don't work here. :D""

She then went into how I looked like a manager because of my mess of keys, and because I was fixing the endcaps. 

I patiently pointed out that while I -used- to work in this store, all employees wear business casual and I'm plainly in jeans and sneakers. That's when she abruptly closed her mouth and hurried off to the section I'd indicated earlier."

5 minutes later.

CM: Where's your vest?

3 minutes later, when the aisle is clear.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d57sek/i_do_actually_work_here_sir/,"I DO actually work here, sir Pretty short one but I thought it was amusing. So 2 or 3 years ago I was a revenue office assistant at a major Midwest zoo. One of my jobs was to, once or twice a week, go around to all of the vending machines in the zoo, remove the bills, replace any change that was running low, and make a note of products that were out. 

Usually I'd be driven to each location by a security officer with a golf cart, due to not wanting to walk miles around a massive zoo alone with a bag full of money. Not to mention it was often super hot out and not having to walk around in restrictive dress pants in 100°+ heat was a blessing. Plus most of the security staff were pretty cool and I liked hanging out with them if I could. 

It was a fairly busy day at the zoo, and I was being driven to one of the really far away machines by my favorite security guard. We passed a few people on the path and he dropped me off at the machine so I could get to work. I pulled out my keys to start opening up the exterior door of the vending machine as the people we passed caught up to us. 
I hear the guy say to his wife ""Oh look, she's special."" then louder to me ""WELL AREN'T YOU SPECIAL?""

I shot him a confused look and keep working. 

""You get to be ESCORTED just to get a SODA.""

His wife kind of tugged on his sleeve and mumbled ""Honey, I think she works here"" but he didn't care. He was ready to go off on me. 

I unlocked the first lock and went to unlock the second.

""Don't we all wish we could have our own cop to--""

I finished unlocking the door and swung it open while making eye contact with him.

""Oh"" he says, and rushes off avoiding eye contact with me. His wife again says ""I told you she worked here.""

I have no idea how it wasn't obvious I was an employee. Despite not wearing a zookeeper uniform, I still had a zoo name badge, a photo ID on my belt, a radio, a zoo-issued cash bag, and a big set of keys. The security officer was silently watching the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it.

I hope Mr. Soda Man made a stop by the petting zoo later to relieve some stress."

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d5a6ik/i_work_here_but_thats_not_my_job/,"I work here, but that’s not my job! Little background

Over the summer I was volunteering at a med surg floor at a hospital. The patients there were either on their way back from/or going to surgery/similar procedure, or under observation. 

My job was to answer the call bells, hand out refreshments, answer the front desk, transfer calls, etc. nothing important. 

STORY STARTS HERE

I answer the call bell but the patient wouldn’t tell me what they wanted over the phone so I went to their room. I get there and the patient tells me that they want their IV machine to stop beeping and to get their IV removed.

As a volunteer, I am not allowed to touch patients. I’m specially not allowed to mess with the machines and anything of that sort.

I tell the patient that I’ll get the nurse for them but this patient was NOT having it.

P: but you’re already here, just do it.

Me: sorry (patient’s name), I’m not authorized to touch any of the machines or the patients.

P: but I’m telling you to so you will.

Patient is obviously getting annoyed and I’m just thinking “omg this is my last week, please don’t ruin my chance of getting an awesome recommendation letter” lmao

Me: I’m really sorry, it’s not up to me. I’ll get the nurse right now, she’s just down the hall.

Patient: this is bullshit, are you kidding me?

Me: eh *walks away*

Later I found out the patient reported me to the nurse manager! I comfort myself by knowing that I didn’t mess with expensive hospital equipment and didn’t put the patient at risk by being intimidated into doing something that I’m obviously not trained in."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d4yyys/just_a_white_coat/,"Just a white coat I think this might belong here.

This happened many years ago and it's safe to relate now and nobody's going to get fired. I'll keep the back story as brief as possible.

I've just finished university and moved back to my home town and thinking about next career move but I'm already moving towards IT. I have an older friend who is a senior lecturer in a biology discipline at the main university in the city but does his (required), research in one of the big hospitals nearby. He asked me if I could write some software for him and his department, no budget so no pay but no big deal as good for my CV /resume.

Pre PC days there was only one Apple IIe available in his research lab in the hospital for me to use so overnights when nobody else was around was normal and I enjoyed it anyway.

Now my friend let's call him Dr T needed to be there to let me in / supervise and discuss what he needed, long days for him but it wasn't full time so no hardship. At the time he was going through a very bad time with his wife and spent as little time in his house as he could so weekends he would mostly go the lab even sleeping there sometimes and I fell into this pattern.

Lab is at the top floor of the hospital and we both smoked so for a break we'd get to A & E (ER), which was the quickest route and go outside. We're both wearing white lab coats and Dr T has his badge too although I don't require one. Smoke break over and walking back in a nurse grabs Dr T by the arm and whispers into his ear, he says to me 'go on up I'll catch up in a bit' which he does.

Anyway this gets forgotten about and we continue our nights developing software for a few weeks. One night I go for a smoke on my own (a Saturday maybe the busiest night in an emergency room), and as I walk back in a nurse steps in front of me and says 'doctor we're overwhelmed can you step in and help us out?'. I'm like 'what?', I'm not a doctor.

Nurse: Yes you are we've seen you with Dr T in here for weeks and he helps out.

Me: He's not a medical doctor.

Nurse: Of course he is why would he treat patients if he's not medically trained?

Me: I have no idea maybe you should ask him.

Nurse: But... Looking at my white lab coat.

Me: It's compulsory working in a research lab (lots of very nasty chemicals and biologicals and why a white coat would provide protection I have no idea but there ya go).

Nurse: Humph, and off she goes doing the clicky heels thing.

When I asked Dr T what that was about it turns out a nurse had asked him the same thing a couple of years previously so he just helped out, she assumed a name badge with Dr in front of the name in a hospital meant medical. Nothing serious of course he just cleaning out cuts and so on, weekend ER is busy with trivial injuries."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d4oqjp/the_restaurant_the_karen_and_the_spatula/,"The Restaurant, The Karen and The Spatula So this happened two days ago during my lunch break.  While the Karen Screetching was not directed at me I was able to observe it all go down first hand.   


Backstory: I have been going to the same restaurant, for lunch, for the past two months. It's a small place, but the food is amazing and prices are low. As any regular, I eventually got pretty friendly with the staff and the waiters. I tip well and always try to be smiling and nice, they deserve it.  As such I know everyone who works there and the manager's girlfriend.  She comes in from time to time to have lunch around the same time I do and we greet each other with a nod and a smile.  That's all the backstory you need, now to the show.   


As usual, I arrive at around 1 pm and see the Karen walking just slightly behind me with her kid. I open the door to the restaurant and hold it so that they can pass. I'll let you guess if she said ""Thank you!"" or not.   


We go in and the restaurant is packed. There are only 3 open tables, so Karen and her kid take one and I the other. Literally a minute later the manager's girlfriend (GF from now on) walks in. She goes up to the bar and talks with her boyfriend, briefly. Due to the chaos, both of the waiters are overwhelmed and GF helps one of them carry a set of trays to a table, she is cool like that and sits down on the last remaining table. 

&#x200B;

Admittedly, service was kind of slow, but due to the sheer amount of people, it was understandable.  Well, understandable for me, not the Karen.  At some point, she just scoffs and bolts up walking to GF's table.   


Karen: Excuse me, can we order?  
GF (caught off guard): I'm sorry, what?  
Karen: Can we order? We have been waiting for 10 minutes.  
GF: You will have to ask a waiter, I don't work here.  
Karen: Ofcourse you do! I saw you carry trays.  
GF: That was just to help.  
Karen: And now you are taking your break?! You just came in! How can you be so lazy?  
GF: Seriously, ma'am, I don't work here.   
Karen: Bullshit! I saw you! You have to take my order.

At this point, a waiter manages to get to them. Meanwhile, I can see her daughter literally trying to unsubscribe from existence.   


Waiter:  Ma'am, is there a problem here?  
Karen: This lazy bitch won't take my order!  
Waiter: She doesn't work here, I can ...  
Karen cuts him off.  
Karen: I saw her working! I want to talk to your manager! She can't behave like that!  


The waiter just shrugs and ask the manager to come.  


Manager: Ma'am, what's going on?  
Karen: She refuses to serve me! You have to discipline her right now!  
Manager (without fucking blinking): I will be sure to spank her with the hardest spatula we have later, but at the moment she doesn't work here and can't help you. Waiter here will be happy to take your order.   


Karen is just sitting there, mouth gaping, as if she was struck by the lightning of Zeus himself.  The restaurant is quiet, GF is blushing a bit, but smiling. I am doing my best to not laugh out loud and failing. You can hear muffled chuckles from other tables.   


After about 20 seconds, the Karen huffs and drags her poor, poor kid out of the restaurant.   


I tipped a lot that day."

Let me just get my things. Yesterday, our community had a ""clean up day."" We've had some problems recently with people trashing the playgrounds, leaving garbage along the streets and just in general not being great neighbors. So to counteract that a bit, the neighborhood association organized a day to clean up those areas. There have been emails and flyers about the day for months. Everyone who volunteered had a job. Mine happened to be helping pull out and replant some plants that have been destroyed. My husband was on the same team.

My team members and I had been at it for about an hour or so when a guy pulls up in a truck. We'll call him ""Raiders Fan"" because he's an Oakland Raiders fan. Anyway, RF pulls up and yells out the window to my husband and the guy helping him. Hubby is my husband. Guy helping him is Nice Guy because he's nice. Now keep in mind we sort of know RF. We're not friends but we know him enough to chat when we're out for walks and stuff. He knows where my husband works and what he does. Not today though!! Today, he thinks my husband and the rest of us are landscapers or day laborers or something. *And scene*.....

RF: ""I'm looking for some people to come do some landscaping work around my house. I'm offering $7 an hour. Can you spare anyone?""

Hubby: ""Ummmm..what??""

RF: ""I need some help around my house. Can anyone on your crew help me? I mean they can come after they clock out if you can't spare them and they want to make some extra money today.""

NG: ""We're actually not a work crew. We're here for the community clean up day. You should have received a flyer about it a couple of weeks ago.""

RF: ""Uh huh. So is this like a prison thing? Where you have to do community service?""

NG: ""No. This is a community service project organized by the neighborhood association. You're welcome to join us if you'd like to help.""

At that point, Raiders Fan looked at Nice Guy like he had two heads and said ""Why the f&#k would I do that? This isn't **MY** job."" I think at that point, the look on my husband's face made him ***really*** look at him. And he realized he'd been talking to his neighbors and not some random landscaping crew he can be abusive to. He suddenly laughed and said ""just kidding!! I'm very busy today. Thanks for helping out!"" Then he sped off.

Let me just unpack this. 1) WTF 2) $7 an hour to work on landscaping projects in the hot sun? You can work in the air conditioned comfort of any fast food restaurant for more money than that. 3) There are people all over the community today working. And there are people literally 20 feet from us, handing out water and getting lunch ready. I'm seriously worried about his eyes because he'd have to be blind to not realize it's a community event. Not to mention the fact that there are *children* running around helping. And he thinks we're convicted criminals doing community service? Sure. Little 7 year old Timmy over there robbed a liquor store and was lucky enough to get community service, Raiders Fan. Idiot."

Naoko \[a work friend\] invited me to Universal Studios Japan. I agreed, because USJ has owls, live, adorable, REAL owls at their Harry Potter Adventure. Which the US does not have. 

Naoko is nervous to go see them because she does not like big birds. I want to go, so I am asking her nicely to come with or wait for me to see them. 

While we are discussing this, someone taps me on the shoulder. I turn around and see a well dressed mother and her eleven year old daughter. They look pretty normal. The mother \[Karen\] is wearing a Harry Potter shirt, carrying several bags, and looking lost. Her daughter is begging to go on a ride. 

Karen pulls out a map and says, ""Hey, do you speak English? I cannot figure out where \[ride\] is."" 

I point in the general direction we came from. I tell her, ""I do. We just came from \[ride\] over there."" 

Karen taps the map with a perfectly manicured talon. ""But where specifically?"" 

Naoko pops in, because she is the most helpful person in the world. That is not sarcastic, she is wonderful. ""You have pen?"" she asks. She mimes drawing on the map. 

I always have pens on me. I tell her, ""Here, if you want, she'll circle it for you."" 

Karen looks like I threatened to carve out her child's eyes and feed it to Izanami for breakfast. She jerks the sacred map to her chest. She tells me, ""DO NOT touch our map. Just take us there."" 

Naoko, like the kid from the Sixth Sense, whispers dramatically, ""We see owls."" 

I can see how annoyed Karen is getting. I am thankful that Karen has made Naoko more interested in seeing the majestic sky cats. Anything, I think, is better than being around Karen. So I tell Karen that unfortunately the fucks have left the building and they will not return this season due to budget cuts in the fuck account. 

I tell her, politely as I can, ""We are going to see the owls. Just ask one of the workers; we found a couple people who speak really good English."" 

Naoko and I are off to see the Wizard. 

Karen says loudly, ""Just take us to the ride."" 

Me: No. We have to go now.

Karen: My daughter is going to be really upset if we don't get to the ride before closing.

Me: Talk to an employee, ma'am, I am not a tour guide.

Karen: But you're American.

Me: So? I live here now.

Karen: So you should help me.

Me: No thanks. Have a nice day.

Karen then turns to her daughter and tells her that I am not going to show them where the ride is so they won't be able to do it before Daddy finds them.

This 11 year old girls proceeds to fall onto the ground and start sobbing.

Karen: Don't you make a scene, \[Freakout\].

So this girl is throwing an absolutely silent fit, pounding the ground with her hands, all while not making any noise. Naoko and I decide we are going to leave. Karen is just standing there while we leave, telling her daughter we ruined the day. Instead, you know, of asking the super bilingual employees.

It was so weird."

I too am Hispanic, but unlike the employees, I'm wearing shorts, sneakers, a polo, and the convention nametag. I was at a little cafe in the convention center waiting for my coffee when, we'll say a Candice, walks up to me.

C: Excuse me, where are the restrooms?

Me (confused by a sudden stanger): I'm sorry?

C: The restrooms. Baño...? (This was said very uncertainly and sounded closer to banjo.)

At this point I'm just very shocked and confused so I don't answer. I guess the Candice realized I wasn't an employee because she got this confused look on her face before walking off.

Also small bit of info, I changed into shorts, blue tshirt and flip flops after of I got off work. This becomes relevant later.

""Ma'am, I don't work here. If you want to know exactly get somebody that actually-""

Then she cut me off.

She began yelling at how I'm not good enough for this job and that I'm lazy, thats why I don't know.

So I found some paint, shoved it in her arms, and watched her struggle to hold them all.

""There you go 'Karen' There's your paint."" I said before leaving with my sketchbook.

It may have came off as rude, but I was fed up with her. I had stayed there about 45 minutes longer than I actually needed."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d4k2yb/pupuseria/,"Pupuseria This is a relatively tame IDWHL. I currently live in a midwestern city that is predominately caucasian, especially in the neighborhood in which I and my family live. POCs aren't prevalent, but they aren't martians either. Many of the ""ethnic"" restaurants are owned and staffed by POCs, but the clientele tends to be caucasian. Lastly, my city has a rep for being very liberal. The mayor and the entire city council is Democrat (nearly all white, too).

  Okay, the story. My family and I attended a newly opened pupuseria restaurant. For the benefit of the few uninitiated, pupuserias serve pupusas, which are Salvadorian ""hot pockets."" The restaurant's owner and waitstaff are entirely Salvadoran. I'm 1/2 black, 1/2 white and I speak passable Spanish. I don't look Salvadorian in the least, PR or Dominican, perhaps. Anyway, my family and I were seated far away from the restrooms. My 8 year old needed to go, so I escorted him there and after he finished, he raced back to the table and I leisurely walked back. On the way, I passed by the table of an older, (white) couple, about 60+. The man held up his hand and looked directly at me and said ""mas augua por favor."" I smiled and replied in English, ""I compliment your Spanish skills, by the way, I'm a customer, I'm sure one of the staff will get more water for you.""  He gave me an embarrassed smile and apologized for the error, and I went on my merry way."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d4icf1/i_dont_think_i_want_a_tattoo_anymore/,"I don't think I want a tattoo anymore... So I wanted a tattoo for a while now but I ALWAYS end up chickening out. So I went with my friend so I don't chicken out.

EM-Entitled Mother. NG-Nice guy. Pk-poor kid (the EM's child). Me-well duh. Lils-my friend. Staff-well it's obvious. XBM- X-boyfriend manager. Popo- Police. 

Background

I'm a single mother of two one is 5 and the other was just born 3 days when this happened so I was grumpy, tired and just wanted to get the tattoo and go to sleep this is probably important to remember. Lils boyfriend took care of my kids while this was happening. Lils looks strong when she isn't and I look weak when I'm actually pretty strong. Also Lils is about 6'8 and I'm 4'3. Also English isnt my first language so ignore spelling mistakes and poor grammar.

Now to the story

So I went to the public tattoo place with my friend. When we went in we only saw 3 people, NG, PK and EM. So we tried to sit down but before we could EM put her bags on the only two seats left. I thought she didn't notice us so I asked her to move them but nope. Here's the conversation:

Me- ""Can you move the bags please""

EM- ""don't worry I'll move them when customers come in""

Me- confused but knows how this was going to go from watching RSLASH, Emkay and other reddit readers. ""But we are  customers""

EM- just looking in one of her bags and bringing out some food ""here sweetie want a sandwich""

PK- ""mum can you move your bags the tall people want to sit down""

EM- ""Sweetie they are employees but if they are just gonna stand there I think they'll get fired""

Lils- moving the bags herself because she just wants to sit and wait

EM- ""HOW DARE YOU I'M TELLING YOUR MANAGER"" she walks off into the staff only room with PK

NG- Nearly laughing his head off ""wow some people am I right""

Me and Lils- ""yea""

Me- ""I really feel sorry for the kid though""

3 minutes later (the staff came back)

Staff- ""I'm sorry to inform you that the manager will be here to open the doors to the tattoo area but he's talking to a crazy lady complain while her kid looks like she's nearly about to cry""

Lils- ""great.."" she rolls her eyes

Me- ""ok"" now I'm feeling nervous not only because of the EM or the tattoo but because the manager was one of my X-bfs.

XBM, PK, EM walks in

XBM- ""who was being disrespectful and assaulted the poor ladies kid""

EM- pointing at my friend (since she looks strong) ""She assaulted my child and now she has bruises on her legs and you can see where she punched her on the head"" then she points at me ""And she threw my bags to the floor and called me a Bich""

XBM- looking at me and Lils trying to hold his laughter ""did the tall one pick up your child to give her bruises on her waits?""

EM- ""yes I nearly forgot about that""

XBM- Now definitely knows this is bulshit ""well unless Lils been going to the gym every day and 'Me' is drunk then this is worst than when you said that my brother kicked your child and ran off (his brother is disabled and has mental problems).

EM- Now red with anger ""I COMMAND YOU TO FIRE THEM""

XBM- ""well your fired 'EM'""

EM- confused ""but i don't work here""

XBM- ""exactly they don't work here either""

By this point NG, me and lils are standing up. Nearly laughing our ass's off.

EM- pushes me onto the ground where I hit my head on the wall and faint. (The rest I knew from NG, XBM and Lils who informed me the rest)

PK- ""MOMMY STOP!!!!!"" Now she's crying her eyes out and runs up to me and lils and hides behind lils and checks if I'm ok.

EM- ""COME HERE YOU LITTLE BRAT!"" she tries to push lils to get PK

NG- ""Not so fast"" he gets pushed but he still is standing ""your not hurting anyone else"" 

At this point the police arrive  (XBM called the police when he heard 'one of his employees assaulted someone')

Popo - ""what's going on here""

XBM- ""this crazy lady pushed 'me' and she fainted and I think this lady might be abusing her child.""

Apparently the police took her away and my friend, NG, XBM were tooken into questioning and I was taken to the hospital. I wasn't in questioning because they had enough proof so she got fined, jail time and her child is in foster care (Lils and her bf is looking after PK as foster parents since they felt sorry for her) I was in hospital for a week and I am still taking therapy for what happened  (among other things). I never got my tattoo and I don't know if I should.

Sorry this is long but I feel better now, NG if your reading this thank you for protecting my friend. Thanks for reading if your reading this."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d48co0/guess_gas_station_uniforms_are_similar_to_office/,"Guess Gas Station Uniforms are similar to Office Store Uniforms? (Obligatory on Phone excuse my formatting and whatnot)
-TLDR at the Bottom
-Aaaand, first time poster here! :D

This technically didnt happen to me, but I was there, and to laugh at it.
My S.O. and I both work at a Gas Station, won't say where, but the team uniforms are a grey shirt, while the manager (and assistant manager's) uniforms are black with a red collar and sleeves. Shirts tucked in, belt and Jean's. Pretty simple.
I had just gotten off of work and needed some pieces printed and laminated (I sell posters at conventions on the side)
S.O. had gotten off work about 2 hours earlier, and he doesnt like to change shirts, so he would just wear his manager shirt everywhere, untucked and with a jacket over it, but still wearing it. 
After my shirt, he offered to take me to a local office store, so then we could get lunch afterwards. (Who am I to say no to lunch with my bae? Lol)

Now! This office store, had a red collared shirt, with Jean's, a belt, and shirt tucked in. 
This store has a section just meant for printing and laminating, there was only one other person in the line. So I'm in that line, while S.O. decides to wonder the store. 

Later he tells me that THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE approach him thinking he was the manager. Two were more of the awkward apologies and then looking for someone else. 
But the third person. They were close enough for me to hear so I can confirm that at least this one happened. 

This person wasnt really that of a  stereotypical *Karen*. Darker hair to the shoulders. No kids. Casual clothes. 
So we'll call her... Carrie.

S.O had picked up a binder, it was the last purple one, and he was looking it over, examining it like it was a fine wine. (It was one of those fancy velcro strap ones)
Carry comes into the aisle, seeing it and was waiting for S.O to stop his heavy examination of it. 
Guess it was too long, cause she clears her throat and finally gets his attention. 
Conversation is based off of what he told me later. 

Carrie: ""Ok, can I have that now?""
S.O.: ""What?""
Carrie: ""Now that you've given it a thorough enough inspection. I would like it. It's the last purple one."" She holds her hand out expecting him to give it to her.
S.O.: ""Uh? No? I would like this for myself.""
Carrie: ""Excuse me? Shouldnt customers pick before employees? I'm sure there's more in the back for you."" 
S.O.: ""Oooh. No no. I'm a customer.""
Carrie: ""Haha, you cant be a customer on shift."" 
S.O.: ""I dont work here."" 
Carrie: ""But you're wearing..."" 
An actual employee approaches and Carrie finally puts two and two together. 
She becomes a flustered mess and apologizes, but then asks if he was planning on buying the purple binder and that purple was her... lucky color or something. 
Being more understanding, S.O. gives her the purple one and he takes a black one for himself. 
By the time I finish paying for my stuff, S.O had bought himself the binder. 

That's when leaving the store, Carrie approaches again. Only to thank him and apologize for her behavior, that he just had this ""Manager's presence to him"" and that's why she assumed he worked there. 
I mean, she wasnt wrong, he was just a manager at a Gas Station instead, haha.
In the car, I asked what happened and he just completely unloads on how he's not coming back here in his manager shirt again. 

We have lunch with his jacket completely zipped up. Lol.

TLDR: Lady assumes S.O. works at an Office store cause he has similar looking clothes and a ""Manager's presence"" to him. All for a purple binder."

Disclaimer: it's been so long since I last had anything to do with posting on reddit that things have changed, and I don't even remember what my old username was or the email I used. Probably a defunct college one. I'm also on a cell, and my autocorrect hates me. It's probably going to be novel length, sorry. 

Some back story, I actually have my education, training, and most of my work experience in English, both literature and language teaching. Despite this, I somehow found myself working for a rather famous ski resort, much to my SoCal native horror. I grew up in both LA and SD. I can handle the cold (-30c is the lowest I've been in, whatever that is in f. I was in Finland at the time), but I learned to despise snow while working at the resort. Six solid months of snow will do that to a person. 

I love my former coworkers/bosses. I even kinda like the company. I loved most of my customers, but that 5%, man. I have a few customers I keep near and dear to my heart to remind myself not everyone's terrible. I have a ton of stories about entitled customers, or entitled parents, both from my professional and personal lives. But I also have a ton of fantastic stories of wonderful people.

Honestly, I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I couldn't find anywhere else that quite fit, either. The main point is that that's not my job. I don't work at the hospital! Go to the hospital for your medical emergencies! 

This particular story involves:

Me=me
My supervisor=supervisor 
Injured skier=skier
Injured skier's friend=friend
Random rude dude in his late twenties or early thirties=RRD

For liability reasons, at the beginning of the season all of us in the ticket office weren't even allowed to give out bandaids. Even if I were a doctor, since I wasn't hired as a doctor, and my job didn't include medical anything, I wouldn't have been able to do anything medical. They did get more lenient about the bandaids, and only the bandaids, later on in the season. 

Only ski patrol was allowed to do anything medical. Unless it was something like CPR, then we became bystanders allowed to do something. I wasn't even supposed to call ski patrol once the injured party was in my lobby, since their jurisdiction ends off the snow. You only need to be told off (yelled at over the phone) by a grumpy ski patrol guy once to go ""nope. I'm not dealing with that attitude from you, too."" I'm pretty sure one of my coworkers and I called and got the same guy, since she backed me up every time someone questioned my not calling them. I deal with enough flak, I don't need them to add to things. 

Back to the main story. I was toward the beginning of helping RRD with his lift tickets when the friend came to my window and asked if we had a bandaid or guaze. He specifically said bandaid or gauze. He pointed to his friend a good 10 feet away from the window and under a burned out light, so he was in semi-darkness. About the equivalent to being outside at dusk. He was in literally the only dark spot in the entire lobby. I could barely see his face, let alone details. 

Thankfully for him it was later in the season, so I said I'd go look. I thought the guy had cut his lip or something, since all I could see was some dark stuff, I'm assuming blood, on his lip. I went looking for both gauze and a bandaid in the back. We had only bandaids, so I grabbed a couple of different sizes and took them back out. I also told my supervisor what was going on, just to keep her in the loop, since we technically still weren't supposed to do this. 

When I got back the friend got upset about the bandaids. I get it. Your friend's hurt, and you're frazzled. But, don't take it out on me, especially since you weren't clear. 

Once he finally told me the extent of the injury, that he was bleeding from inside his mouth, I told him the best thing to do would be to go to the hospital about a mile away. I don't know what it was from, whether a broken/missing tooth, split lip, or what. It really doesn't matter, what matters is that with something like that, even ski patrol sends them to the hospital. 

RRD got mad at me, and started personally attacking me, my character, morals, if I had a heart, everything was personal. I told him I could do nothing. I'm not a doctor. It's literally not my job and I could get into serious trouble for doing anything more. I told him not only was I not supposed to call ski patrol, but that with anything like that, they'd send him to the hospital anyway. 

He got angrier and demanded to speak to my manager. I said, fine and got my supervisor. She ended up handling everything he needed. 

She later told me that he seemed like he was just trying to pick a fight and was possibly unstable, just because of how out of proportion he blew things. 

Did I feel bad for the skier? Yes. Could I do anything? No. Do I even know what to do? No. I'm not a doctor! I'm not a nurse! I have no idea what to do, except to get gauze to help with the bleeding (which we didn't have) and go to the hospital. Seriously, people, just go to medical medical professionals for your medical emergencies! What is a sales person supposed to do for you?"

This little elderly lady starts talking, I assume to her husband. I kept walking. She starts following me, but I think no she’s not it’s just my anxiety making me paranoid. Well I stop to look at a Halloween display. I usually move to the side if I think someone is following me to let them by, cuz I can go slow sometimes. Well she was following me. 

This little elderly lady stops and looks me in the eyes gesturing with her fingers to move closer. I lean in and she whisper-asks where the feminine products are. I don’t use those anymore, so I shrugged and gently pointed to a sign that said hygene thinking it’s there. Then point out that I don’t work there. She proceeds to go on about how I should be better at my job and huffs as she walks away. 

Later on I ran into her again and she was telling a manager that I was no help. He just laughed and told her I don’t work there. He apologized for her bothering me. That was that.

So I was working for a midwestern grocery chain. I had a car loan so I'd also taken a job at a local gas station. Well I got my loan paid off, I was sick of grocery and the gas station paid more so I put in my two weeks. 


My two weeks was up on a Thursday but my mom who also worked at this location was battling cancer and had an appointment on Friday so I came in one last time to cover her shift.  


For this shift I was out watering plants in the garden center and I tripped over something and broke my arm. 
I came in for something two days later for some reason and one of the cashiers told me I really needed to look at the schedule. I in confusion told her ""But I don't work here anymore"" to which she responded ""exactly"".
So I took a peek and not only was I down for the next two weeks most of these were for truck. 


So I approached HR like... wtf. The response was, well we need you. Like lady... even if I did still work here I just broke my arm WORKING HERE. I'm first of all not cleared to go back to work until I get my cast (was still in a sling at that point) even if I was cleared there is no way I could possibly do truck with a BROKEN ARM. 


She said she expected to see me for my next shift (spoiler alert- she didn't see me for that next shift.) 


She ended up getting fired for doing things like this and only hiring all her shady friends."

Here in Croatia, the average height for a woman is 166.49 cm ( 5.46 feet), and I am about 172 cm ( 5.64 feet) currently. Then I was shorter then but still tall enough to be mistaken for an adult. 

I was in that store with my mom and dad, mum and I were looking for a pair of pants. I was leaning on a wall when an elderly lady approached us (my mum and I). She asked me if I could help her with something. As I said earlier, I wear nothing in common with an employee. Yet this lady asked for help. My mum and I had to explain to her that I don't work here. After the ""ordeal"", lady apologized and left, probably embarrassed. Then my mum and I joked about it when we were in a car, dad drove. Don't worry, we found a pair of the pants I wanted.

This was a long time ago, I still go to that store. Their pastries are delicious and I love most of the food products. Sadly, I don't have any other ""I don't work here"" stories."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d3nzog/dont_you_know_who_we_are/,"Don't you know who we ARE?!  This happened more than a decade ago, names have been redacted or altered to maintain anonymity, please forgive formating, on mobile. 

 i had already switched from chef work to sommelier work, having left my first big sommelier job to take over as head sommelier/executive manager of a restaurant group. The city i lived in was the capitol, lots of embassies and lots of politicians, so the high end restaurants would often get large parties of politicians and ambassadors. Because of this sort of clientelle we had very high end wine lists at all our restaurants, but not all of them were super expensive food wise, and our house wine was very affordable, also had lots of good wine by the glass.   This made some of our locations very popular as a lunch spot for servers who worked in the area. 

  
  One cloudy day i was sitting in a corner banquette, just doing paperwork, enjoying some mousaka rollups (like eggplant parmigiana almost but rolled up and with mash potato inside as well as the cheese, tomato and herbs, this was a specialty for this greek meze restaurant).   

  
  The server on duty was pretty busy, she was new and didn't know me, i knew her tho. she was doing alright serving everyone without too much problem, no one was waiting more than a few minutes to get attention. 

  
  There was also a server from the restaurant across the street (not part of my group, but a regular) sitting and having a glass of house wine as she was organizing her tips from her shift, she looked like a server, in blacks, with a black short apron. Similar uniform to what was worn in our restaurant. 

  
  In walks a bunch of people, group of six, i recognize one of them as an ambassador's aid, didn't recognize the others, 4 guys and 2 women, one of whom had the classic karen hair do.   They don't wait at the front where the sign says to wait to be seated, they walk right into the dining room, push two tables together and grab extra chairs, they're sitting sprawling taking up lots of room in the middle of the dining room, talking loudly about how “this place has a great wine list” one of them says he's gonna order. 

  
  They have now been in the restaurant for less than 2 minutes total, the server on duty can't see them from the corner where they do their side duties, she had been in the back serving the VIP room. At this point the group are already starting to complain that they havn't been served yet, which is when they notice the server from the other restaurant who is just enjoying her glass of wine.   

  
   ambasador's aid- substantially 	louder than it needed to be: “HEY YOU, YOU CAN'T DRINK ON THE JOB! 	WHY HAVN'T YOU TAKEN OUR ORDER YET?!”

 karen hairdo – not at all under 	her breath : “I can't believe how unprofessional that girl is! 	(then to the girl) WE'LL HAVE YOU FIRED FOR THIS! DO YOU KNOW WHO WE 	ARE?!”  	 

ambasador's aid – ""this is an 	outrage!"" 

Not our server girl – ""Oh um 	sorry i don't work here, i work at a different restaurant, I'm sure 	a server will be here to take your order soon.""

 Karen hairdo – ""don't you give us that bullshit you lazy good for nothing! \*incoherant mumbls\*  

  
  at this point i'm already not liking where this is going, but i decide to wait a minute to see how the new server handles it, she has arrived with her customer service smile plastered across her face.

  
   actual server –"" pardon me i'm mandy and will be your server for the day, can i take your order?  

  
   karen hairdo - “FINALLY! We've been waiting here for 20 minutes (maybe 3 tops) with NO SERVICE ! And your collegue 	here didn't even get up to greet us! She's just getting drunk, you can't drink on the clock (directed with malice at the innocent 	server girl from another restaurant) you need to fire her right now! I DEMAND to speak to your manager! Do 	you even know who i am!? I WORK FOR THE (redacted) consulate, i could have BOTH your jobs for this!”  

  
  it was at this point i finally recognized the lady, she was a receptionist for the consulate where she worked, i had seen her a year and a bit prior when she came with a large group for their office christmas party. I could have stepped in at this point but i was curious how the new server (mandy) would handle this. 

  
   mandy in an apologetic tone – 	""I'm so sorry but I didn't see you arrive, normally people wait to be seated as the sign asks so I couldn't see you all sitting here. Please don't badger our guests though, that lady doesn't work here 	and is a paying customer. I believe she works at another restaurant 	down the street.""

 Karen hairdo cuts her off – 	""DON'T YOU DARE LIE TO ME YOU LITTLE (redacted racial slur) I EAT LIARS LIKE YOU FOR BREAKFAST! ""

 Rest of the six are egging karen hairdo on at this point and i can see this may be escalating beyond what the server can handle. so I text the owner's son who lives upstairs, he's also a part owner in the group and sometimes does some managing of this location, happens to also be a body builder 	and is HUGE. Less than 30 seconds later I get a “brt” text from the owner's son. 

   
   karen hairdo – yelling in a shrill indignant voice -"" WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?! GET HIM NOW! You 	can't treat us like this! WE ARE IMPORTANT PEOPLE!”  

  
  mandy was starting to look like she was going to cry at this point and the not our server is shrinking back into the banquette as both of them were being yelled at incoherently by this group of 6 rude flunkies.  At this point the assistant floor manager has arrived due to the screeching, but the 6 insane screechers are just ignoring her. 

  
  I stand, take a couple steps toward them, take a deep breath and at the top of my lungs shout “QUIET NOW!” 

i was an actor in high school and know how to project, so my voice fills the room.   Everyone stops their shouting and turns to me.  

   
   me – at a more reasonable voice 	level – “Okay so here's what's going to happen, none of you need 	to speak to a manager, what you need to do, is grab your stuff, and  get out. I won't have you shouting at my server, or my guests, no 	one deserves to be talked to the way you have been. And before you indignantly ask me if i know who you are, i do, i know exactly who you are, and i know your boss, and your boss's boss, both of whom love eating here and would be appalled at your behaviour!”  

  
  at this point i notice Mathiew, the owner's son has just come in through the kitchen door, dressed in his gym gear, glistening with sweat like some sort of Greek statue of Heracles, 6ft4 and nearly 300lbs of muscle. The look on his face just screams “I just got here and I'm already completely done with this” . 

  
  I can see karen hairdo is about to protest but i hold up my hand. And in my no nonsense commanding voice - “no, this is NOT a discussion, get up, and go, NOW!” 

  
   karen hairdo in an injured indignant tone - “well i never!” 

me , mater of factly – “and you never will again, you can consider yourselves banned from this establishment!”  

 Mathiew (owner's son/part owner) rather louder than he really needed to be - “Get out of my restaurant and don't even think of coming back, you're all going on the black list!”  	  

  
  Mathiew's colossal form starts moving towards them and it seems the look on his face was enough to end any further discussion as the group grab their things and rush out of the restaurant.   I thank Matt for coming down and interrupting his workout for the assist.   The manager comp's the not our server's meal and wine for her marred experience. Our server is told she did nothing wrong, that it's okay, she's not in any danger of being fired and in fact handled it about as well as she could have, she is given the rest of the day off with pay. 

  
  The group each have a headshot pulled from security cams and are added to our digital blacklist, but it doesn't end there. I call the consulate and talk with the ambassador who is appalled by the behavior of his staff, all of whom arrive back at the consulate that day to find they had been fired for attempting to use their job to bully others.   He comes in personally the next week to apologize to our server, manager and the owner's son in person, and assure us that the group no longer work at the consulate. 

  
  Moral of the story; never use your position of perceived power to bully others, you may well end up losing that position."

Before I can even get my food set down on the machine I hear the loud clack of flip flops and PK's continued ""excuse me's"".

She now arrives to the self check out center, child in tow, face red from anger. She informs Kiosk Lady that I was making ""rude remarks about her parenting"", ""harassing her"" and ""refusing to help"". KL looks at me confused, clearly realizing I don't work here, and says there's not much she can do, other than get a manager who could ask me to leave.

PK looks thrilled at this news and requests it immediately.

I at this point am finished purchasing and ask if I can just go because I'm done shopping and need to get home. PK cuts in with ""you can't go unless they dismiss you"".

Me, finally realizing what is going on tries to clear up the situation.

ME: I don't actually work here, sorry about the confusion, but I really just want to leave and get home.

PK: I know you work here, I've seen you a dozen times. I don't care who covers for you, you won't lie your way out of this.

ME: Are you sure you recognize me ma'am?

PK: Of course I recognize you, how could anyone forget that loud, tacky, hair.

At this point PK has attracted not only the attention of the manager, but the security guard by the front door. I'm not thrilled from the comment about my hair, so despite my best judgement I decided to tell her exactly where I worked.

""I'm the receptionist at a marijuana dispensary. Are you sure that's not where you've seen me?""

As I flipped my hair off my shoulder to reveal the stores logo I'm pretty sure her face became a new shade of red that had gone unseen up until then."

https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d30ovn/lady_didnt_know_we_understood_spanish_and_it




Oh boy! My assistant is 1st generation American, her parents are from Mexico. I love her as a sister, we have worked together for over 15 years now, and she is truly an amazing woman! Unlike her sister and parents, she has much lighter skin (she often jokes that her mom cheated on her dad with the mailman or our boss as her mom was his son's nanny). She was raised learning both Spanish and English. She can get hot tempered really quick too! I ask her if she ate some spicy food on those days. Oh! Her mom makes killer pazole and tamales!!

Anyhoo, one day a woman crashed into several cars on the street in front of my assistants home, she was living with her parents. One of her parents cars was struck and damaged. She was the first one out there to make sure the lady was all right, asking her in English the basics, are you alright, what happened, making sure she was not in need of emergency services, we are trained in basic first aid and CPR, etc (the lady was okay). Immediately the lady went full on Spanish stating she could not understand her, she didn't speak any English.

My assistant was rightfully offended and straight up gave her a verbal assault for being a racist b***h! The lady's face turned whiter than my assistant, (well, I was told whiter than me which is pretty impressive as I'm quite pale) she apologized, and quickly backed off to talk to someone else.

This crap happens to her more than she would like. For me, I think she looks as Mexican as it gets, sure her family have darker skin, but her roots are really obvious!  Apparently she is seen as a mixed child that more than likely doesn't speak Spanish at all. She tells me about these interactions and I make fun of it and get her laughing about it. Our sense of humor is pretty much the same, we know each other very well, and I know when she needs me to either be a goofus or listen to her as she vents. She is one of my favorite people in this world."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d3phrc/yes_i_work_here_no_i_dont_work_there/,"Yes, I work HERE. No, I DON’T work THERE This happened when I was about 19 so many years have since passed.  I worked in the downtown of a town in a very famous tourist area known for its wine.  To be very clear, I worked in a local coffee roasting company and was only 19 so my knowledge of legal drinking venues was pretty limited.  Usually I was an opener and out of dodge by 2pm with tips in hand but this particular day I was a mid or closer.  Don’t recall which but it was around 4pm so could have been either shift.  

At this time the downtown of this particular town wasn’t exactly where the tourists went.  At risk of giving away where, tourists were drawn to the things located “up valley” and this town is “down valley”.  So we get the occasional tourist but mostly locals even in peak season.  I was remaking the vat of coffee at the self serve station and grabbing a few dirty plates to wash when a typical white mid-western older tourist dude walks in.  White polo shirt, khaki shorts, excessively sporty shoes; you know the type.  The rest of his party stays outside on the narrow, busy sidewalk.  

I say something to the effect of I’ll meet you at the counter in a moment.  Clearly holding things that are dirty in my hands.  He lets me know he just has a question.  Gist of the dialogue as it’s been many years:

Dude: can you tell me where “wine drinking restaurant” place is?

Me: I’m sorry I don’t know that one.  Maybe go down two blocks to the tourist info booth and ask there.  They should be able to help with that.  

Dude: no, you work here, you know where it is.  TELL ME!

Me: (I was 19 and absolutely had a quick temper and a bit of snotty attitude) yeah, I work in this town but I’ve never heard of that “wine drinking restaurant”.  Sorry.  It’s not far to the tourist booth.  

Dude: you have to know.  You work here it’s your job to know this!  

He’s getting louder and louder at this point and the spot we’re standing in is narrow and awkward because we are partially blocking the front door.  

Me: my job is to make coffee.  I gave you directions to the tourist booth.  Go ask them because it’s THEIR job NOT mine.  

I start to move past him.  

Dude: why won’t you tell me where it is?!  I asked a simple question!  Tell me where this place is!

Me: no.  I told you I have no clue and I’m only 19!  I can’t legally drink and it’s NOT MY JOB to know this!

He stares at me blankly and I go to move around him as a regular walks in.  The regular gives me a weird look and knowing he works at the courthouse maybe he knows so I ask him if he’s familiar with “wine drinking restaurant”.  

Courthouse Regular: nope.  Never heard of it.  Go down to the tourist booth

Dude: you people are useless!  This is a tourist town and you need to know these things to help us!  We pay for you!

Courthouse Regular:  I’m a lawyer.  Not my job

Me: walks away and makes regulars regular drink.  For free because ftw 

Dude finally walks out and loudly tells his melting family that we don’t know anything in there!  They stomp off towards the tourist booth after all that

Thanks for reading and sorry there’s no police justice"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d3r4ie/tales_from_adventurers_league_attack_of_the/,"Tales from Adventurers League: Attack of the Entitled Planet So I play alot of D&D as a hobby and i love to DM games on a regular basis. Unfortunately i live in a small midwestern town, so i rarely get people for private games. Luckily for me, the game shop in town hosts Adventurers league, which is an organized campaign group developed and ran by Wizards of the Coast (the company behind Dungeons and Dragons). Without any alternatives, I started DMing AL games at this game shop. Ive been doing it for years and always have had fun.

About a week ago, i wanted to start a new private group. Because i was bored with experienced players, i decided i wanted to get people who were new to the game. So i put up fliers around town saying i was looking for people who wanted to learn to play D&D. After a week of people applying and interviewing i decided on five people to make up my party. 

The party consisted of a Barbarian, a Wizard, a Paladin, a ranger, and a rogue. Most of them were in their late teens early 20s, except for the rogue who was a kid around the age of 12.

I set our first session for the next week. Considering this was their first ever time playing i decided to do something special. When i texted each of them the date of the first session i also asked them about their favorite color. When the day of the first session came, i went to the game shop early and bought each of my players a $4 set of Chessex dice in their favorite color. When the players came in they were happy and grateful... except for Rogue. 

Rogue looked at his dice and got a disgusted look on his face. I noticed this but continued on with the session. But all throughout the session, he was very standoffish and was very unenthusiastic. This started to become a bit of a problem. So, when we came to a break, i pulled Rogue aside and asked him what was wrong.

Rogue: I dont like my dice.

Me: ok, what didn't you like about them?

Rogue: They're ugly and i dont like the color.

Now, to be fair, these dice were pale green with yellow accents to them. So i have to agree they were not the most attractive dice. Because i felt like i made a judgment error, i decided to rectify the situation.

Me: Ok, well how about after this session we go over and pick out a set that you like.

Rogue: Really?

Me: yeah, i dont want you to hate your dice. But, im going to need you to be engaging with the group. 

Rogue agreed and his mood changed considerably. We continued with the session with no problems. 

When the session came to a close, Rogue jumped out of his chair and ran straight to the dice. After i packed up my stuff and quickly chatted with some of the other players, i met up with Rogue. However, when i approached him i noticed he had already picked out a set of dice. A $50 set of pewter (metal dice)[https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gsra1PhNL._SL1500_.jpg].

Me: Umm... bro, i ain't buying you those.

Rogue: But these are the ones i want.

Me: I know, but those are $50.

Rogue: But you said i can get whatever set i like. I like these.

Me: Dude, i was expecting you to pick a cheap set of dice. Those are just too expensive. Im still willing to get you dice, just not ones that expensive.

Rogue thought about it and got my point. He begrudgingly put down the metal dice and apologized to me. We then spent a good 10 minutes picking out a set of reasonably priced dice. He settled on a nice Green and black set of $8 Chessex dice. Once that was settled he thanked me and we left. 

Now, i hoped this was going to be the end of the story. Unfortunately, as I've stated in the past, God hates me and wants to prove it.

So a week passes and im back at the game shop setting up for the next session. After i finished setting up, i noticed i had some time before my players showed up. so i decided to kill some time by talking with one of the employees. 

Suddenly, in the middle of our conversation, i felt a disturbance. A shift in gravity caused my body to feel like it was being pulled into something. The air smelled of Fried chicken and sulfur. I knew in my heart that something wicked was coming.

Entranced by Curiosity's seductive power, i turned to look at what diabolical force was approaching. What my eyes saw was a short yet extremely obese woman wearing a muumuu and sporting a haircut that said ""I want to speak to your CEO""... and she was glaring at me with the anger of a thousand Beholders. 

From behind her, i could make out (surprisingly) a familiar shape. It was Rogue. It suddenly dawned on me that this was his mother. 

RM: Are you the guy who runs the Dungeon and Dragon game!?

Me: Uhh... yes?

She then rushed towards me with speed i didn't think was possible for her. Within seconds she was right in my face.

RM: My boy told me you were being mean to him!

Me: how so?

RM: He told me you wouldn't get him the set of dice he wanted!

Me: the dice he wanted were $50. I offered to buy him a set of dice that was under $10.

RM: WELL HE WANTED THOSE DICE AND YOU OFFERED TO BUY THEM FOR HIM! SO BUY THEM!

Me: im not buying him those dice. They are $50.

RM: DONT YOU DARE TRY TO JEW ME! I KNOW YOU GET AN EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT!

Suddenly, the employee that i was talking with chimed in.

Employee: Ma'am, i can asure you that this man doesn't work here.

RM: DONT YOU DARE LIE TO ME! I KNOW HE WORKS HERE!

Me: Ma'am i dont wo-

Without warning, she slapped me across the face. This was no light slap, this was a saitama level slap.

Now, to his credit, Rogue tried to intervene by telling his mom to calm down and that its no big deal. 

RM: I DONT WANT ANY SASS FROM YOU, BOY! 

She then turned back to me

RM: NOW YOU GET MY SON WHATEVER HE WANTS OR ELSE I WILL HAVE YOU FIRED! DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR!?

Me: LOOK LADY, I DONT WORK HERE AND IM NOT BUYING THOSE DI-

She then slapped me again

RM: HOW DARE YOU RASE YOUR VOICE TO ME! I WANT TO SEE YOUR MANAGER!

Even though i was at my wits end, I tryed one last time to reason with her.

Me: READ MY LIPS: I. DONT. F***ING. WORK. HER-

She then slapped me one last time

RM: DONT YOU DARE CURSE IN FRONT OF MY SON! 

Now... im not usually a confrontational guy. I typically try to keep my calm as best as i can. But after she bitch slapped me a third time, something snapped in my mind which lead me to say some very harsh things.

Me: LISTEN UP YOU FUNDING CRAZY HAM-PLANET GRUNT! I DO NOT AND HAVE NOT FUDGING WORKED HERE! I DO NOT GET A FUNDING EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT AND I WILL NOT FUNDING BUY YOUR CROTCH GOBLIN A SET OF FIFTY FUNDING DOLLAR DICE! FURTHERMORE, DUE TO YOUR SHITTY ACTIONS AS A PARENT, YOUR SON IS NO LONGER ACCEPTED AT ANY OF GAMES! NOW SCREW OFF!

RM looked visibly surprised and insulted.

RM: IM NOT LEAVING UNTILL I GET THOSE DICE.

Me: WELL IT LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR SAUSAGE FINGERS AND STICK THEM UP YOUR DRIED OUT SNATCH, FIND THE $50 THAT YOU MADE LAST NIGHT WORKING THE STREET CORNER, AND BUYING THEM YOURSELF! BECAUSE THATS THE ONLY WAY YOUR GETTING THOSE DICE! NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF MY FACE BEFORE I SLAP 400 POUNDS OFF OF YOUR RALPHIE MAY LOOKING ASS!

At about this time, i snap out of my temporary insanity. RM looked stunned as if no one had spoke to her like this, Rogue's mouth was agape in disbelief, and the employee was a mixture of horrified and trying to hold back laughter. 

I braced myself for whatever retaliation she was about unleash on me. Suprisingly, she grabbed her son and walked out of the game store. As soon as she did, the employee burst out laughing.

Once my players arrived, i explained what ended up happening as well as why Rogue was not going to be playing with us anymore. They all had a good laugh.

About an hour into our session, the store manager pulled me aside to ask why he received a call from a woman claiming that one of the employees was insulting her. I told him what happened and how she hit me multiple times causing me to snap. After confirming on the security cameras, he told me that although i was justified in defending myself he couldn't allow me to insult his customers. He told me that he was banning me for a month.

I accepted and informed my players that we had to move venues. We're playing our fifth session tonight at my place and i got a new guy to replace Rogue."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d3pu26/no_i_can_not_reserve_a_table_for_you/,"No, I can not reserve a table for you... Not sure it fits here entirely, since the mistake happened on the phone, but I don't know a better sub to put it in.

Backstory: I work for a non-urgent ambulance service (think not immediately life-threatening, but patient needs an ambulance to get to hospital).  As such, we have a shortened number in my country - think if 911 is urgent medical care, we're 011 or something like that (not in US, don't know if there's an actual equivalent).  The problem is, a lot of companies use ""press 0 to get an outside line"" - in most cases, people accept it's a misdial,but some keep arguing.  This one seems worth posting, even though I only got in at the end.

People involved: Caller ""John"", coworker - Jeff (fake name - he does have a noticable regional accent), me, restaurant owner Jim (only mentioned - presumably from same area my coworker comes from).  All dialogue translated to the best of my ablility.

\*telephone ringing\*

Jeff: ""Welcome to \[redacted\] ambulance service, how may I help you?""

Caller: ""Hi Jim, it's John here, I'd like to reserve my usual table for 4 next Saturday if that's possible""

Jeff: ""I'm sorry sir, I think you have a wrong number.  You've arrived at \[redacted\] ambulance services.  Do you need medical assistance?""

Caller: ""Haha, not unless you've really gone downhill.  Just my usual table at the window please.""

Jeff: ""Sorry sir, you've called \[redacted\] ambulance services.  I think you may have a wrong number.""

Caller: ""Stop fooling around Jim, I can hear it's you.  I'll assume I'm ok for my table for 4 on Saturday?""

Jeff: ""Really sir, I work at  \[redacted\] ambulance services.  Unless you need medical assistance, I can not help you""

Caller: ""Yeah right Jim, I'll see you on Saturday""

Jeff: ""Really, you have a wrong number sir, if...""

\*Click\*

Coworker looks over at me and tells me about the call, wondering if we should call back telling him his reservation is not ok.  We got interrupted by real calls.

A bit later:

\*telephone ringing\*

Me: ""Welcome to \[redacted\] ambulance service, how may I help you?""

Caller: ""Um....  I'm not at restaurant ""Golden spoon""?""

Me: ""No sir, you've reached \[redacted\] ambulance service.  Do you need an ambulance sir?""

Caller: ""Um...""

Caller: ""...""

Caller: ""I was talking to Jim before about my table on Saturday....""

Me: ""I think you have a wrong number sir, you've called \[redacted\] ambulance service.  We do not have anyone working here called Jim""

Caller: ""No, no, I called to reserve a table""

Me: ""I think you have a wrong number sir, you'll have to call the restaurant for that""

Caller: ""...""

Caller: ""So am I ok for my table on Saturday?""

Me: ""I don't know sir, you'll need to call the restaurant for that""

Caller: ""...""

\*click\*

Turns out the caller later did call back again to our boss to apologise (in my country you can get a hefty fine for prank calls to emergency numbers, which we are a part of even though we're non-urgent).  Apparently he said Jeff sounds just like Jim, who's known to pull pranks on his friends.  I don't know if he ever got his table.  Not the best story here, but gave me and Jeff a chuckle - and we definitely don't work for a restaurant, neither of us have since we were students!

TL; DR: caller calls ambulance service to reserve a table for next weekend.  Refuses to believe it's a wrong number because call taker sounds like (has same accent as) the restaurant owner.

Edit: got fake names mixed up, thanks for pointing that out!  
Edit 2: missed one trying to fix it"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d3g2q6/jerk_wants_my_mom_fired_at_a_store_she_doesnt/,"Jerk wants my mom fired at a Store she doesn't work at, while my mother refuses to be fired.  

LONG, and poorly written. Sorry. I'll try and remember to put a TLDR thing at the bottom. Also, posted on Entitled people, but it was suggested I should do this here. 

So, there is a store in town where the employees wear plain black paints, and Plain red shirts. My mother was there with my father, and she was wearing plain black pants, and was wearing a red and white shirt. Of course, we all know that entitled people are not smart enough to realize that the shirt she was wearing, was not the same shirt that the employees were wearing. Both of my parents told me what happened, so I got a pretty clear picture of what happened.

Not too clear on Dialog though, so I'll just give a rundown on what I was told.

While my parents were looking at cleaning products, our EP walks up to them. He DEMANDS attention from them, because he can't find the aisle with canned meat, even though he would have to go right past it to get to the cleaning Aisle. Dad tries to talk to him, but the EP was ""talking to the employee, not some Wetback.""

Mom stepped in quickly, and realized he was talking to her about the meat. She tells him she doesn't work there, and then tells him what aisle he was in. She was trying to keep dad from going at the guy. The EP just walked away, and went to that aisle. They got what they needed, but they encountered the Ep.

Dad said that he called mom something nasty, though wouldn't say what he called her. the EP accused my mom of lying to him, because he looked all over that aisle, and didn't see any canned meat. He demanded my mother (using that nasty name again) to show him where it was at.

My mom said, in her calm but angry tone, that she does not work there. Even if she did, she would not respond to a completely rude man like him, and that if she had worked there, she would find a way to ban him from the store.

An employee that was in that aisle, suddenly found his arm being pulled towards the EP. the EP got nose to nose to this poor guy, and told him to get whoever was in charge there, he had a complaint. then he all but threw the guy back. Dad was able to catch the guy before he fell over. Mom started scolding the EP for almost hurting that young man, and I wasn't told how he replied. After a few minutes, the district manager came in, learned the story, and asked the EP to stand aside while he talks to ""this employee about her attitude.""

the EP wanted her fired and out of there right now, accused my mother of calling him something nasty, and refusing to help him.

So, the DM took my mother aside, and told her that he is going to pretend to fire her, so the Jerk can leave.

this is the only part where there is dialog, based on what I was told.

My mom: Wait, are you saying that you are going to bow to his wishes?

DM; Well, if it keeps the peace, yes. If he keeps complaining, he's just going to cause trouble. So, I'm going to 'fire' you-

Mom; Oh no you are *NOT!* You are *not* giving into his demands! You are *not* going to 'fire' me, because he will go around thinking he can get anyone who works here or anywhere else fired!

DM; Oh, he comes in here a lot, and always causes this kind of mess with customers, so it's just easier-

Mom: \*Cutting him off again\* If he comes in here a lot and does this every time, then he is a problem! He is always causing trouble, so you deal with him, not go with the easy fix!

DM: But you don't work-

Mom; \*Cutting him off a third time\* Doesn't matter if I do or not! He treated me with such disrespect, called my husband a Wetback, nearly hurt one of your own employees, and you're going to feed into that ego of his because it's '*easier*'? What happens if he gets pissed off at a **real** employee, are you going to throw that *innocent* person under the bus because it's '*easier*?'

DM: Well-

Mom: \*a fourth cut!\* how would your corporate offices feel about you letting a man who constantly harass employees and customers into their store? Think they will take your side on this that you are costing them customers? Do you think that they will like it if they find out how you allow the mistreatment of your staff? That you would fire an employee without probable cause and create lawsuits?

My dad told me how the DM didn't say anything because he knew he would be cut off again.

Mom: That man is creating a hostile work environment, and you're helping him. Either do something about him, or I'll call corporate and have them talk to you about it!

So, the DM, trying to save his own ass, goes to the EP and tells him to leave the store. The EP threw a fit, and tried to throw a punch, but the DM easily ducked and warned him to leave. The EP did so, cursing the entire time. The DM apologized, promised that he will do what he can to have that man banned, even for a little while.

When my folks paid for their stuff, they saw the EP hanging around in the parking lot, waiting for them. They told an employee, who talked to a security guard, who then went outside, and pretty much kept the EP distracted while my folks rushed to the truck, and threw their stuff in. They hoped they weren't seen as they left, and my mom was so angry her face was completely red when she got home. She just took a shower, and is trying to calm down, dad and I put the groceries away, but dad told me that he'll take me to the other store across town tomorrow if I wanted to go shopping tomorrow. We both didn't want to chance seeing that EP.

TLDR: EP harasses mom because he thinks she's an employee. Tries to get her fired after he was rude to her. Mom refuses to pretend to be fired, not wanting to give that guy that kind of fire. Convinces the District Manager to have the man leave and will see if he can't get him banned."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d3asak/never_snap_your_fingers_at_someone_to_get_their/,"Never snap your fingers at someone to get their attention. This isn’t the typical IDWHL story but does technically fit. I consider myself a patient and cool-headed guy, not easily angered or mad even in tense situations. However, I do have one trigger from my childhood that gets me instantly enraged. Living with my abusive Aunt, she snapped her fingers every time she wanted you to do something. So, if anyone snaps their fingers to get my or anyone else’s attention, I go from a Level 1 to 10 in seconds. It’s something I’m fully aware of and my friends joke with me on it. Adams Family theme song is my ring tone for when they call. 

But a few weeks back, I’m at a “Buy-N-Large” that is not my usual store I go to. I’m wearing a business button up long sleeve shirt and black slacks. I’m also in sneakers and no tie, just casual nice. I’m passing through the clothing tables in the middle to see if they have anything I like. I first hear the snapping fingers like it’s a gunshot. I instantly look over and this large woman is facing away and trying to get the attention of an employee. My rage at hearing the snapping is at an 8 and my eyes are staring daggers at this bitch but she is unaware of my presence. 

I’m just far enough away that I don’t hear their conversation, just bits and pieces that she’s trying to find an outfit in her size. It’s not likely given her ample size. The female employee with the headset is politely helping her look through the stacks of clothes and that’s all the interaction I see take place. I calm down enough and go about my business. I know what I want there and it’s to pick up a few select items in the back and freezer section. 

Roughly 10-20 minutes later, I’m trying to find where a particular item is as it’s always been down the same aisle in every store. I look around for an employee and find the same female with the headset walking toward the employee’s section in the back. I politely ask her where said item is or not sold at that store. She’s as perplexed as I am as it’s not her area. She radios into her headset and someone in the back goes to check on a computer. While we are waiting, I inquire about the lady who snapped her fingers at her. The female employee is cool about it and shrugs it off like it’s all part of the job. Smiling even, saying that it’s a fairly common occurrence.  WTF?!?!

The person on the radio informs us that said item is on a different aisle up front so the two of us walk there. I leave my cart off to the side of new aisle out of the way of traffic. We chit-chat about the item and why it’s so good, maybe 10-15 seconds of dialogue when I hear a female voice loudly shout, “There you are, I still need your help and you go walk off.” She then snaps her fingers and points down as if she’s to heal by her side. I’m instantly enraged to 10. She wasn’t even talking to me but that didn’t matter. I lock eyes onto hers and make a B-line over to where she stood. “Don’t do this…” I snap my fingers inches from her face three times. Each time she winces back with bug eyes and an open-mouthed gape. The female employee was quick on the take and intervened before I could go off on an epic rant I had rolling around in my head since I first saw her do that. The woman could only sputter nonsense like I had slapped her. Never taking her eyes from mine, for fear I would attack her or something. 

There were quite a few people gawking at the spectacle and several more employees intervened. When the GM came, the fat bitch instantly put on the water works and starting hysterically recalling what happened. I was pissed off, but in full control of myself and thinking clearly. I was far enough away, standing still, breathing slowly while she was freaking out at the gall that someone would “attack” her like that. Her mistake was when she said through blubbering lips, “I want that man fired! He attacked me! Everyone saw it!” 

The puzzled look on everyone’s face was evident. The GM, the female employee, the others who came in later. “Mamm, who are you talking about?” I chimed in with a cool and calm voice, “The rude one here believes I work here. So instead of firing me, I quit boss.” Didn’t get the laugh I was intending but it did defuse the tension like a charm. The woman yelled back, “**You do too work here**! I saw you talking with her.” Pointing to the female employee next to me.  The GM looked at me, I looked back and calmly said, “Yes, as a customer, I asked your wonderful employee here where the…” pointing to the item that moments ago, was requested over the headset. “item was. And here it is.” 

The woman goes into another hysterical fit garbled frustrated noise’s, none of which are English. GM pulls her aside to calm her down and I go back to my cart with an employee escort. I purchase my items and stand in the receipt checking line. I look around and see the bitch walking with the GM towards the manager’s office. I snap my fingers to get her attention but only the GM looks over with a bit of a scowl. I head out of the store intending never to come back. 

Not that exciting of an ending but I did ruin her day and that’s plenty of satisfaction for me. I called the store later that evening to get any additional information and to apologize for my part in the fiasco. The new MOD was made aware of the situation but didn’t know many details. He thanked me for my apology and would relay to the GM when they talk next. I asked if she received compensation for her “troubles”. He assured me she didn’t.  

I don’t regret what I did nor will I apologize to her for it. If she doesn’t know that snapping your fingers to get someone’s attention is rude and degrading, she deserved the aftermath of someone does it to her in return. 

**TL:DR** Lady snaps her fingers at the employee I was talking too, I barrel up to her and snap my fingers back at her inches from her face. Thinks I'm an employee because I stood up to the employee and because she was nuts."

Been following for a while but never had a story to share until today so here goes.

I'm sitting in a burger pub in an outdoor mall in Indiana.  The pub along with the entire mall is pretty much dead since it's a Thursday afternoon. In fact I am the only patron in the entire restaurant at the time.  I'm eating a late lunch, have my laptop out, earbuds in my ear, and am enjoying one of those big fancy margaritas along with my food.  The margarita had one of those mini beer bottles upside down in it as well so it's pretty clear from a distance that it's an alcoholic drink.  Not really sure if that matters or not but it certainly would be out of sorts if an actual employee was sitting at a table drinking one while working at least.

Anyways a confused Karen walks in and starts circling the restaurant.  She then stands about ten feet away across from my table and is looking in my direction. Again not really paying her any mind and I'm thinking maybe she is just looking for a hostess or someone that can assist with takeout since there weren't any actual employees on the floor at the time.  Still not paying her any mind until...

Karen: *walks over to the opposite end of my table and starts knocking on the table* and says ""HELLO.""

Me: uhm yeah?

Karen: I need to use your bathrooms is that okay and where are they?

Me: Sorry but I don't work here so you might want to ask someone who does.

Karen:. But I need to use the restroom now! Is that ok?!

Me: uhm I guess?  Again I don't work here.

Karen: *storms off into another section of the restaurant while mumbling F--- something under breath*

A couple of minutes later, Karen is back again and still huffing and puffing about restrooms.

Karen: The doors locked so what am I supposed to do?

Me: I guess someone is in there so you'll have to wait?  Again I don't know because I don't work here and honestly your starting to p--- me off by pestering me.  After all it should be fairly clear judging by the fact that I am not wearing the work attire for this restaurant and am also sitting here drinking a big a-- margarita so please leave me alone!

Karen: well then I guess I'll go somewhere else then! *storms off in the direction of the exit while muttering several unintelligible F---s along with mentioning how rude I am.*

Me: Have a blessed day!  Come back and see us again soon!

After Karen storms out, the bartender walks over to see what the issue was as she overheard the tail end of the exchange.  I explained what happened and we both laughed about it.  She said that the other person working (my waitress) was currently in the restroom (and on break) and she was covering for her.  She apologized for the confrontation and even offered to comp the drink for the hassle.  I stated that wouldn't be necessary but now I do have a funny story to share."

Cast: Me- Me, June- an 80-something woman, and Bob- June's 90-something husband, not seen in this story, but mentioned, and Amy, June and Bob's Great-granddaughter

&#x200B;

I was once again shopping in Walmart, this time doing some grocery shopping for my grandparents, when I felt a tap on my shoulder.  I wasn't in anything resembling the uniform of the store, as anyone who read my previous posts knows, but I reacted.  I turned slowly, half expecting to see a red-faced, 40-something woman with a bob about to rip into me, but no.  I saw a kind faced, 80 year old woman with glasses.  The exchange is as follows.

June: Excuse me young man, can you help me?

Me: Well ma'am, I don't work here, but I used to.  Since you were nice to me, I'll help.  What do you need?

June: Can you tell me where I can find the Pharmacy?  My husband has some pills he needs picked up, and I'm not from around here.  I live in (Town that's about three hours away).

Me: I'll do one better.  (I offer her my arm politely) I'll take you to it

June smiled happily and I walked her to the Pharmacy, stopping every little bit so she could catch her breath, which I didn't mind one bit.  After we got to the Pharmacy she picked up Bob's pills and thanked me, and I told her it was no problem at all.  I asked her if she needed help to a vehicle, at which point she told me ""I have to call my great-granddaughter to pick me up""

Me: There's a Subway we can sit at and wait on her, I'll keep you company until she gets here.

June: Are you sure?  I don't mind waiting for her by myself...

Me: Ma'am, it's about 90 degrees outside(Summer decided to hit us one more time this year), and the last thing I want is for you to sit outside in that heat alone.  I don't mind at all, I finished my shopping a while ago.

June and I sat in the Subway talking for the 45 minutes it took her Great-granddaughter to get there, she was in class at a local community college and told us she would try her hardest to get out there as soon as she could(June put the phone on speaker).  I politely told her I didn't mind keeping June company while she did her class, and June and I had a nice talk.  June told me how she met her husband, about her three kids, seven grandkids and two great-grandkids, and showed me pictures of them all, and asked me about my work life, not once did she ask about my personal life, and I didn't divulge too much.  When Amy got there she looked at us and thanked me for helping June, and offered to pay me, which I declined.

Amy: But you helped her when you didn't have to!

Me: No, I did what I would want someone to do for my own great-grandma.  I was being nice, and I gave her very good company, which is worth more than money.

Amy thanked me and then told me the reason June was three hours from home, she was visiting the other great-grandchild, who was only three months old.  I chuckled a bit and gave June a hug before parting ways with them, June giving me a wave.  On my way out though, I heard June exclaim, rather loudly

June: Amy, why can't you find yourself a boyfriend like that nice young man?

I just heard Amy laugh before they drove off, and I couldn't contain my laughter.

&#x200B;

No shouting, nobody being banned or arrested or tased, just a case of someone being kind to an older person

&#x200B;

TL;DR- Helped an old woman at Walmart, kept her company and waited on her ride with her.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the reactions!  It's such a shame that in this world my behavior is seen as being admirable, when it should be standard for people.  Thank you to whoever it was who gave me silver on this, I'll spend it on...  Idk yet, I'll find something!  And on to the elephant of this post: Amy and I.  I'd have tried, but unfortunately for me I noticed she had a ring on her finger, an engagement ring on it.  I know better than to try shooting my shot like that.  I've seen her and her fiance a time or two on other shopping trips to Walmart, he's a good guy and all, but June didn't like him at first because he's black, though she's coming around.  You know how old people are, she's getting better about him.  I ran in to her yesterday when I went to get some stuff for dinner, and we sat in Subway and talked again while she waited for Amy.  She told me it was how she was raised, and she's trying harder to open her mind.  Now her biggest complaint about him is his taste in music.  She's old-school Gospel, he's 90's Hip-hop.  I let her know about this post and, in her words...

&#x200B;

""Well of course you got a lot of love, a lot of people won't sit and talk with an old woman, let alone help them.  It just goes to show that people need to be more respectful of their elders, and teach their kids the same thing.  You thought about your great-grandma and helped me, that's what people need to do, just think of their older relatives and help!""

&#x200B;

Well, she said much, much more, but that's the simplified version of it.  Once again, thank you all for reading this, for the comments below, the karma, the silver, all of it.  I'm glad you've enjoyed this tale of my trip to the Temple of Sam Walton.  Have a glorious day/night/morning you wonderful people!"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d3fexl/apparently_having_strobe_lights_means_i_work_for/,"Apparently having strobe lights means I work for a tow company. A few days ago I was driving into a busy intersection where there was a car sitting at the light. Not out of the ordinary at all I know, but that's the only thing that is.

I'm driving a truck for work, and we have a warehouse just up the street from the intersection I was now sat behind at. For a light cycle, I stay behind her in the turn lane and oblivious. I was fiddling with my music while I waited so I didn't notice we'd gone through an entire cycle when I hear tapping at the window beside me. I look out and the lady had gotten out of her car and walked back to me and was now staring me in the face with her older son (mid 30s) staring at me and standing in front of my truck. She didn't look like a Karen at first, more sweet older grandmother type so I rolled down my window.  


""Yes?"" I ask, now confused.

""Why don't you turn your fucking flashers on dumb-ass!"" She yells at me as my window is about half down.

I was a little stunned. I don't know her, I don't know him, and i'm certainly not on a job-site. Looking at her car, i start to realize she's a disabled vehicle and she's broken down.

""I SAID TURN YOUR FLASHERS ON AND HELP ME!!!"" Yelling at me extremely forcefully.

Now, I'm normally alright with helping people out when they get into trouble but I'm no tow service. I work for a local telecom provider, and my truck isn't what you'd call a tow truck. Its a Tiny, 2004 Ford Ranger, I don't even have a tow hitch on the back and my decals are huge and plastered all over the truck saying who I work for and with the company branding everywhere. Not easy to miss at all as its on the doors, the hood and the tailgate.

""I'm sorry, I can't help you ma'am I'm heading to a job, you sh--"" I was cut off, right as I was going to recommend she call a tow company.

""You work for the towing company and I've been waiting over an hour, now get out and help me NOW!"" Screaming a little more before turning to her son and walking back a few steps, seemingly assuming I'm going to get out of my truck. I have no intention of doing this and simply tap the door panel on top of the gigantic decal.

""Ma'am I'm sorry but I don't work for a tow company. I work for (Ye Olde Telecom Company) and I cant help you with your car. If you'd like, I can call the police and have them come to stop traffic though."" We're friends with a lot of local cops and they usually enjoy riding out to help us with stuff like blocking traffic anyway cause they get to chill in their car often when we call. I'm about to get my phone out when she starts yelling again.

""You have strobe lights on your truck, you have to help me!"" She yells in exasperation, pointing to my strobe lights. Because we work in a field that involves doing roadwork and construction, we do have yellow strobe lights its true, but that's all vehicles that work along or on the road. It's required in my state and our company just has them like anyone else.

""Ma'am... I really don't have time for this, I can't tow you and I don't work for..."" I start to explain and roll up my window. She then steps forward and puts her hand in my window (I have manuals so i just stop rolling to keep from smashing her fingers.

""You will help me RIGHT NOW! Or I'll call your boss and get you fired!!!""

At this point, i'm just flabbergasted, and put my car in drive so that I could leave. The son who until now had just stayed quiet moved to block my car from leaving and I start getting really worried at this point. I've had people try to claim injury or insurance from ""accidents"" in the past, so I just put it back in park as now there are other cars behind me and if he won't get out of the way, I have no way to leave without hitting him.

She starts pulling out her phone, looking at the door panel. ""I'm going to call your boss RIGHT NOW!"" as she starts dialing the phone number which is just the Gen. Support customer service number and she gets the automated ""Welcome to (Ye olde Telephone Company) Greeting.

Normally, with this information you'd think that this angry woman would put it together that... My tiny truck, decked out in decals and calling and getting the automated call in attendant would tip her off to the fact that I really don't work for a tow company but no... instead she shoves her phone in-front of the window and yells through at me.

""I don't want to pay my phone bill, I want to talk to your manager, get him on the phone and I want you written up and fired for refusing to help me!"" She yells, almost in tears as I'm almost laughing at this point. It's been a while since I've had someone just act so irrationally I can't contain my laughter as she finally moves her hand out of my window and I roll it up the rest of the way.

Through the window, she starts yelling at me, and I start to ignore her, picking up my own phone and calling the police but instead of asking for help I tell them about this crazy lady holding up traffic and threatening me, and keeping me from driving away. They sent an officer right away who was actually just up the road a block or two, and he was there in less than 2 minutes. Pulling up, he instantly got out and asked her what was going on.

Within moments of him getting here, she's walking up to the cops car, ""You need to arrest this man, he won't help me get out of the intersection!"" Great... that is not my job. I instantly knew where this was going and I wasn't at all worried. The cop, who was one of the guys I'd worked with a lot, and had actually shared beers with looked in, nodded and said to me ""Give me a minute."" as he stands back up and looks at my truck and her car.

""Ma'am, you're car has no damage on the rear end. I see no cause for an incident, do you need assistance or is your car actually disabled?"" He asks her, very accommodatingly as I look on. He's quickly  scanning both vehicles again and the son as the mom starts to gibber about. 

""My... um... no my car doesn't run at all."" she states, a little less confidently. She goes forward and turns the key, and indeed the car doesn't run. It turns out though, that the car was just out of gas. So instead of behaving like a normal human being, she instead accosted me and as my friend put it ""endangered traffic"" because they were blocking traffic and falsely holding me from leaving.

They deny this, and then I pull my trump card. I tap on my dash mount, which is an older android phone but one that I use dash-cam software on whenever I drive. It looks just like a phone in a mount, but if you didn't know, you would never have guessed that it was running special software and had recorded the entire interaction. Added bonus! I had wired up an external microphone to it a few weeks ago so I captured audio. So the entire encounter, her banshee cries, her actions were all on camera and on audio recording. (I won't share these for privacy reasons, but it was more than enough to have her instantly stop the charade and instantly go red in the face with embarrassment.)

My friend asked me if I was ok or if I wanted to press charges for anything. Assault or for False Imprisonment and I just waved him off, I didn't care much for more paperwork I just wanted to go on with my day.

In the end, Karen and her son got a ticket for impeding traffic, a non moving violation, and the cop got them some gas from a tank some cruisers keep in their vehicles for stranded vehicles just like this. All of this was just a 10 minute inconvenience for me, but just goes to show when people don't know how to respond to a situation, they just as easily blame someone else for issues as simple as filling up their tank with gas. I would have been more than happy to run up and get her a gallon myself if she'd just have asked nicely but now, she's sitting with a ticket and a fine because I happen to have a set of strobes on my vehicle."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d379qs/im_working_but_i_dont_work_here/,"I'm working, but I don't work here. This isn't a really dramatic story or anything, kinda boring, but figured I'd share.

So I work for a food delivery service where people place orders on an app and I accept the order, pick up the food from the restaurant, and deliver it to the customer. This job doesn't have a uniform, so I was just wearing a hoodie (a World of Warcraft hoodie to be specific) and jeans. I go into a sit-down restaurant to pick up an order (I don't remember what the uniform for the restaurant is) and walk up to the podium where the host stands to seat customers. I tell them who I am and the name the order is under and they walk back to the kitchen to check on the status of the order. I'm waiting at the podium, looking at the details of the order on my phone, and holding a bag in my hand that keeps the food warm until its delivered.

A family gets up from their table and starts walking toward the door when the mom comes over to me and says ""excuse me"" and I turn around.

Lady: I just wanted to let you know that someone really needs to go check the bathrooms. 

My first thought is, why is she telling me this? Is she warning me against using the restroom? Then it occurred to me that she thought I worked there. I've read this sub before and thought wow, it finally happened to me. I mean, technically I AM working, but I don't work HERE and don't look like I do at all. I'm just waiting at the podium like every other customer who comes in to the restaurant. My second thought is, please don't be a Karen. Since I am technically working, I could get in trouble if I end up having to tell off a Karen. Though it wouldn't really upset me that much to lose this job, since it isn't my only job and doesn't really bring in much money. If I had to lose it to tell off a Karen, it would be worth it, but I wouldn't want to give a Karen the satisfaction of knowing she got me fired, even if it was from a crappy side job.

The woman rambled on and on about how the bathroom was filthy, a toilet was clogged and overflowing, it was disgusting, etc. Suddenly, after almost a full minute of rambling, she took a good look at me up and down and stopped talking. 

Lady: You don't work here, do you?

I just kinda awkwardly smile and repeat back ""I don't work here."" I probably should've interrupted her to tell her sooner.

Lady: Oh, I just assumed because you were standing at the podium. I didn't even look at your clothes. I'm sorry. I'll find someone who works here to let them know. 

Me: It's okay. \*laughs awkwardly\* Yeah, someone definitely needs to address that.

She walked away and about a minute later the host comes back with my order and I take off. The lady was nice even when she did think that I worked there, so thankfully not a Karen. But it finally happened to me, uneventful as it was, so I wanted to share the story."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d3fc8n/karen_insists_a_security_guard_must_work_for_the/,"Karen insists a security guard must work for the bus line  

This story didn't exactly happen to me directly, but I did witness it and was sorta briefly involved. For a bit of background, the city I live in has security guards that monitor the bus stops downtown because there's a lot of drug addicts and such that hang out around there. They don't actually work for the transit system though, they're managed by a security company. 

The cast:

Me = well, me

K = Karen

SG = security guard 

So this one day I'm waiting for a bus at one of said bus stops downtown. An older lady approaches me, and while she didn't have the classic Karen haircut, she appeared to be in her 40's or 50's and her behavior quickly outed her as a Karen. 

K: Excuse me, what time is it? 

Me: It's 5:25. 

K: Well \[bus route number\] was supposed to be here at 5:15! Where is it? 

Me: Oh… I don't know.

K: I need to get on that bus! It's 10 minutes late! I've been here since 5:00!

Me: Well… I'm sorry, that sucks.

I go back to looking at my phone and try to ignore her, but then this security guard happens to walk by. Karen asks the security guard when \[bus route number\] is coming.

SG: Sorry, I don't know, but I can check the schedule posted on the bus stop to see what time it's supposed to arrive. 

K: I already saw the schedule! It was supposed to be here at 5:15, but it's 5:25 now and it still hasn't come yet. I've been here since 5:00 and it was supposed to be here 10 minutes ago!

SG: Oh. Well I'm sorry ma'am, I don't know why it hasn't shown up yet or when it will be getting here. 

That's when Karen starts shrieking.

K: WHY DON'T YOU KNOW? DO YOU NOT KNOW YOUR JOB?! 

SG: Ma'am, I'm just a security guard. I don't work for \[transit system\]. I suggest you call \[transit system\] customer service to find out what's going on with the bus. 

K: WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO CALL THEM? YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR SUPERVISOR! 

SG: My supervisor only manages security. He wouldn't know anything about the bus. 

K: DO YOU WANT MAD CUSTOMERS? YOU MUST REALLY LIKE MAKING CUSTOMERS MAD!

SG (walking away and shaking his head): Look, just call \[transit system\] customer service and ask them. 

K: THAT IS NOT MY JOB TO CALL THEM! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO YOUR JOB!

At that point the bus I was waiting for (different route than Karen's) showed up, so I didn't get to see if anything happened after that. I don't know if Karen ever caught her bus, but I know she rode the crazy train!"

The water taxi has a special dock that is on a bike path that I like sitting next to when the weather is nice.

Well, today I am dressed in denim shorts, flip flops, a fluorescent yellow shirt that has the image of a skeleton hand raising its middle finger and the phrase back off on the back. I also have yarn and a bag with me to work on an afghan. 

As I am sitting by the river working on the project, I get asked if I am with the water taxi. I say no, tell the person what I know about it, and direct them to where they can possibly find out more. 

But, if someone is listening to music, has on denim shorts, a bright yellow shirt and flip flops, there is a good chance they dont work for the water taxi.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d2uy2i/why_does_your_employee_dress_like_a_slut/,"""Why does your employee dress like a slut!!!!"" This story happened when I was still in high school. I was shopping at a clothing store I go to very often. Usually the stores are stuctured so that they have the women's, men's, and kids' clothes in sections connected by small walkways, but each section is its own separate room. Its really not hard to navigate because there are clear signs everywhere. I like to wander through all the sections, because I often find clothes that will fit me. 

On this particular day I went after school on a friday. My school has a uniform that consists of a white or blue polo with a plaid skirt, and is widely recognizable in the area. The skirt was mid-thigh length on me, due to my height. While it wasn't exactly knee-length, I wouldn't call it short either as I could safely bend down. I had an armful of clothes that I was going to try on later, and I accidentally knocked some clothes off a rack with a hanger that was sticking out. The decent human thing to do would be to pick up what you dropped, right? Well I bent down to pick it up when I hear someone huff and storm up behind me. I thought they were angry I was in the way so I apologized to her and walked off. She wasn't a Karen, she was older lady. She was Karen's mom. I'm going to call her Glenda. Suddenly, Glenda grabs my shoulder and jerks me backwards, making me drop my armful of clothes. 

Glenda: Why were you IGNORING ME. I've been following you for 8 MINUTES NOW. You didn't even acknowledge me!!!

Me: Why did you touch me? Do I know you? 

Glenda: YOU F\*CKING KIDS. I do not need to introduce myself to you to get your help

Me, still oblivious but annoyed: Im sorry, what do you need MY help for? 

Glenda: Are you dumb? Are you useless? Why did they hire you? I want to know where the hell blah blah is and I can't find it because of your confusing store layout. 

Me: I don't work here. You can follow the signs.

Glenda: LIAR. You kids are sooooo lazy. I can SEE you work here you have the collared shirt on--

At this point I just turned around to walk away. I could hear her screaming after me about managers and how Im incompetent but I just wanted to get out of her near vicinity as soon as possible. Unfortunately my plans of escaping were foiled as I needed to pick up my clothes that dear Glenda threw on the ground for no reason. As soon as I bent down Glenda screams ""DON'T DO THAT AGAIN YOU SLUT DONT BEND DOWN IN YOUR LITTLE SKANK SKIRT. THEY SHOULD FIRE YOU FOR HOW YOU DRESS ALONE.""

Unfortunately this isn't a satisfying story where I pressed charges and got Glenda put away for assault. I was 14 and dumb and hated confrontation so escaping from her was the best I could do. I picked up my clothes and put them away on the fitting room rack and left because I didn't feel like trying anything on anymore. On my way out, I saw Glenda yelling at someone who I presume is the manager and pointing in my general direction. I waved and walked right out. Best believe I'd be much more vindictive if it happened today. 

tl;dr entitled lady thinks I work there because of my polo shirt, assaults me and causes me to drop the clothes I was holding, then proceeds to slut-shame me for bending down to pick them up after I refuse to help her"

I work at a pizzeria, whose location is around a lot of businesses. Lunch is our busy time, because we get suits coming in for their lunch breaks.

I am taking people's orders as they walk inside, and we are fairly busy, so I haven't left this station for quite a while.

In storms a wild Karen. Her hair is a little long, but she's got the face, and one of those floral business-casual tops that middle age women seem to have by the closetful. She also has the aura of entitlement that comes with karenhood.

Me: ""Hi, welcome to ______, what can I get started for you today?""

Karen: ""I need to speak with your manager.""

Not surprising. 

My manager is about 5 feet away on the secondary line, training a new guy and helping him make some of the orders. We had a special that day, so they still had several pies to make.

Me: ""Liz(name changed for ambiguity), this woman wants to speak with the manager.""

Liz: ""Okay, I'll be right there.""

Karen is within hearing distance, but I still turn and let her know, ""She will be with you shortly.""

I then take the next persons order and hop on the front line to help make some pizzas to clear our orders.

I can hear Liz trying to teach the new guy portions and trying to help clear the orders on the second line.

Karen is starting to turn red from holding her entitlement too long.

After about 5 to 10 minutes, Liz comes up to the front line to grab something they were out of on the back line.

Karen: ""NO! You already helped him, you need to help me now!! I'm done waiting; you're going to help me!""

This woman wanted the manager to stop everything she was doing to talk to her... in the middle of lunch rush.

Liz: ""Okay mam, I'll be with you in just a second.""

My manager then tells new guy to ask me for help on where the item they were out of was, and if he needed anything. 

I hop onto the second line to help, but can still hear most of the conversation.

Karen: ""I need you to fire your delivery driver that delivered my order.""

Liz: ""We don't have any delivery drivers.""

Karen: ""Yes, you do! I had my pizzas delivered!""

Liz: ""Was it a (food delivery company) order?""

Karen: ""I ordered from you guys! I called and talked to someone and placed my order for delivery.""

Liz: ""Can I see your receipt, mam?""

Karen hands over a receipt, while explaining, ""Your driver was an hour late delivering my food. I wasn't going to have any time to eat it. It was completely wasted. I think you need to fire him.""

Liz, looking at the receipt: ""Mam, this is a (food delivery company) order. You placed your order with them, and they deliver it for you. They don't work for our company.""

Karen: ""NO! They deliver your food, so they obviously have to work for you. He needs to be fired immediately.""

Liz: ""Mam, I cannot fire him. He is not my employee. He works for (delivery company).""

The Karen scoffs, ""Well he was an hour late. He should have called to tell me he was going to be late!""

Liz: ""He isn't our driver, mam. I don't know what to tell you on why he didn't call.""

Karen: ""Well you should have called me when he picked it up, and let me know he was late!""

Liz: ""We don't do that. We make the order as it comes in, and the driver picks it up when he gets here. You didn't place the order with us. We wouldn't have called you.""

Karen: ""Well this is a complete waste. I didn't get to eat my food because he didn't bring it on time. I want a refund. This is ridiculous, I couldn't even eat my food, he was SO late.""


My manager refunded her... some days you can't win. Hope the new guy enjoyed his first day."

I couldn’t find a reddit for involving people not knowing you can speak their language so if anyone knows one let me know?? Much appreciated 🙏🙏🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️

Me and my twin are versed in multiple languages. (Probably because we’re mixed we know English and Spanish but we’ve branched our on more as well)

My twin speaks Spanish, Italian, and English.

While I speak Spanish English, and a little French, German, Japanese, and Italian. 

Anyways to start with the story me and my twin (gender-fluid though presents more female; was in more masculine clothing today minus her booty shorts.) so we had been confused for boy girl twins about four times. Of course this is not our entitled people.

We were about three aisles down on our list and we’re going to kitchen ware to look for cups. When these to Spanish speaking girls(one wore a Mexican flag so I assume they were Mexican.) 

Now my twin had a lanyard on so I guess they weren’t really paying attention to what she was wearing and started to ask her some questions about where stuff was in broken English. 

My twin turned to them and explained we could maybe point them in the right direction(as we shop here a lot) but that stuff had been moved around recently so we didn’t have an idea either. 

They seemed nice enough and apologized for not realizing it. 

But as soon as they turned away they started chattering and what they said came out to(in Spanish) “That stupid ugly gringa couldn’t he or she or it(reverting to English for the word it)just explain that it didn’t work here.” 

They favored in referring to my twin as it. 

The other girl piped up with, “Yeah it should have. Don’t even know why it(saying it in English)was comfortable coming in public. Stupid ugly ass gringa.” 

My twins face was mad and sad at the same time. They just wanted to leave but I wasn’t having it so i turned around and said at the top of my lungs, “¿coño lo que dice?” Which translates to (c*nt says what?)

They both turned and the color drained from their face. I proceeded to yell at them about how all we were was nice and than their little chicana busts were going trash talk my sibling for being nice and respectful and that they shouldn’t have to have said anything about no working there as it was clear from how they were dressed as Wally World has a strict employee uniform. 

They frowned and got mad at me scolding them and my twin had to pull my arm to get me to walk away but not before I repeated said above, than said “comer mierda!!” Which translates to (eat sh*t)
And flip them off.

Honestly like I don’t know why they felt the need to be so rude for one and for two y’all trash in Spanish because they thought we wouldn’t understand them and it wouldn’t pass by our ears. 

I don’t if it counts as entitlement but they were definitely rude and also threatened to get a manager but my twin and I quickly left as we were done shopping for the day after that."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d2t8ca/i_want_to_speak_to_your_manager/,"‘I want to speak to your manager!’ Once about a year ago I went to an outlet store with my girlfriend. I worked at another retail store in the area so I had on all black teeshirt and black pants and I still had a name badge for the store which I worked at. The employees of this store we were visiting all wore a blue polo and khaki pants (so nothing at all like my attire). 
 My girlfriend was trying on clothes in the fitting room and I was waiting outside on a bench, scrolling my phone. There was no fitting room attendant in sight. 
 A woman walked up to the bench next to me and stood staring at the rooms. I assumed she was also waiting for someone. As my girlfriend had a lot of things to try on she was taking a while. We both sat patiently and waited. 
Randomly the woman says ‘Really?’ I look at her and she is looking at me but I’ve said nothing to her so I ignore it thinking she’s mumbling to herself. She then gets MAD and says ‘I want to speak to your manager!’ This time it was obvious she was talking to me. Baffled I said ‘I work at U***’ (Not the store we were at) She looks confused for a second and I say ‘There is nobody manning these fitting rooms, you can just walk in. ‘ she looks me up and down one more time and then starts laughing to herself ‘Why didn’t you say something?’. She was obviously uncomfortable but I didn’t laugh back I just shrugged. I mean she didn’t even say anything to me when she walked up! If she would have said something right away I would have told her to just go in. 

Later another customer at this store walked up to me and waited for me to acknowledge him (really awkward because I was just shopping) and asked me if I had a pair of jeans in his size. I said ‘I don’t work here.’ He just apologized and walked away.

EDIT: Lots of people asking why I had a name badge on. I had left strait from work to go to this store. The name badge was bright pink and said the name of the store I actually worked at. Yes I forgot to take my name badge off but still.
 
Also, obviously I took off my name tag after the first occurrence. So the second guy really had no reason to come up to me. I was just an edgy looking teen with all black on￼"

First time posting here and still sick so please be gently with me. English isn't my First language so please excuse my grammar and spelling


Brief Backstory: I am currently very sick and you can hear that by my beautiful sick person voice and the sniffling and coughing 
Also i have A LOT of scars on my left arm on the lower part due to extrem self-harm a few years ago.
I have Depression, Borderline and PTSD
I am trans, from female to male, on Testosteron for 2(?) Years.

Meet the Cast! NOL= Nice old Lady, K= Karen, NK = Nice Kid, M=Manager, Me- Me


So i came down with a pretty nasty cold but I still needed to go grocery shopping. Since it was pretty warm and I was running hot anyway I took of my jacket. Since I get anxious and irritated  with too many noises at once I wore my hadphones and had music on.
I was trotting through the canned good asile looking for soup when the Nice old Lady approched me.

NOL- Oh excuse me, would you mind getting me [Insert Item] from the top?

Me- (having taking Off my Headphones when she approched me and grapped the Thing she wanted and put it in her cart) here you go, do you need anything else? (Here i started coughing violently and very painfully)

NOL- Oh dear, that sounds bad. I'm sorry for bothering you. I hope you get better fast. Thank you very much.

We then parted ways and I put on my Headphones again,
I kneeled down to Look at some soups when i noticed someone stepping next to me. I looked Up and next to me stood a boy probably 6 or 8 i'm bad at guessing ages.

NK: *Pointing at the scars on my arm* Did you fight a Bear? *Very excited*

Me: *laughing nervously* The biggest one you'll ever see.

NK: Wow! You're so cool!

Okay listen, I didnt want to explain to a sweet innocent Boy what self harm is and I was very tired.

Before I could say anything else I heard someone in heels coming towards us. I grabbed my soup and put it in my cart.

K: Finally, I was looking for someone to help me for hours now! What kind of costumer Service is this?! *Standing in front of me expectantly, hands on her hips and everything*

Me: *very confused* Ehm...sorry?

K: Don't give me that attitude! Now do your Job and help me find [Insert Item] before I get really angry! *Not quiet screaming but getting louder*

Me:  I- Sorry, Ma'am I just moved here and don't know the store that- 

I didnt occur to me that she thought i worked there, i was basically in my PJs, my hair could use a shower and I was getting anxious due to her raising her voice.

K: I don't Care! That's it, I'm so sick of bratty girls being lazy and rude! I want to speak to your manager right now! *Now screaming*

Me: *starting to get panicy* I-I'm Not- I'm a Boy...

(I was not wearing my binder but still, I got a nice stubble going on.)

K: [Now looking me Up and down and noticing my arm] What kind of shop employes freaks like you!? *Grabbing my arm and lifting it Up*
Look at that, how disgusting! I don't want some psycho around my child! You're probably escaped from some hospital for psychopaths!

By then I was shaking, in absolut Panic, in tears and not able to utter a single Word.

The manager had heard the screaming and came looking what was happening.

M: Excuse me, what is going on here?

K: Your employee attacked me and my boy when I asked her to help me! I want her fired and arrested! *Still Not letting Go and pulling me this and that way by my arm*

Me: P-Please let me go, please let me go, let me go let me go *by now my PTSD kicked in and I was sobbing*

Manager: Ma'am, please let go of him or I have to call the police.

Karen: No! I don't want some insane freak running around my child! *Grabbing me even harder and grabbing my hair in the other hand*

Me: i'm sorry i'm sorry please don't hurt me *ragged breathing*

The rest is gone for me because I had a Blackout. Next Thing I know is that Karen is getting dragged away by the police and me sitting in an office with the saint of a manager who had given me bis jacket at some point.
The Kid came Up to be before His father picked hin up and a said sorry for his mother. Such a sweet boy, really.

The police asked me if I wanted to press charges against her but I just wanted to go home.
Lady was banned from the Shop for life and a friend picked me up and brought me home where I hid in my bed with my Cat and my friend watching Ghibli movies.

That's it. 
I have no clue what the heck was wrong with that woman, but that never happend to me before and I hope it never ever happens again. I feel so sorry for the boi, he was such a sweet child really.


UPDATE:
I went back to the Store a few days ago and the same Manager approched me.
He told me that the Woman was banned from the Store and that the father came in a time ago and gave him his phone number because he wanted to talk to me.
I am curious by default so I called him and asked what he wanted to talk about. 
First off he told me how sorry he was about His wives behaviour 
He is going to divorce her and wants to get full custody over his son. Depending on how it goes he wanted to ask me if I would be willing to give my statement of the inccident because it might help to get full custody.
I agreed in a heartbeat. This sweet boy and father deserve to much better than her. We talked a long time on the phone and he told me alot.
I wouldnd do it for myself but for the Boy i di"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d2wp4d/my_little_sister_being_called_a_dirty_mixed_child/,"My little sister being called a dirty mixed child 
This is both an entitled story and Idwhl story. But involves me my sister and a chicana. 

So to explain real quick I’m a proud mixed child. 

On my dad side I’m black,French, and German and on my moms latina, native american(Cherokee),and Irish. 

Sadly the German, French, and Irish won the fight. So I’m fair haired with light green eyes and pale skin. I am actually a proud Latina as I pretty much identify more with that side thanks to growing up around my papi(my mamas husband),great abuela(papis mom), great abuelo(papis dad), and my two tios(uncle)

I have always never been attacked for being mixed because most people don’t know and don’t really care unless you are close to me. Or hear me talk. 

My little sister however got a lot of Native American and Latina. She’s tall and has tan skin and beautiful tan colored hair. As well as brown eyes. 

However due to how she was raised she doesn’t actually relate more to the Latina side as she isn’t around that side much. 

I speak some Spanish though sometimes it’s broken and sometimes I fumble as I speak (English, Spanish, and French.) so I try to teach my little sister as much as I can. She can’t really speak it but she does understand what I’m saying when I talk to her. 

So we were walking through the aisles of wally-world 
And I was conversing with her. She was telling me a story about some girl bullying her and how it didn’t really bother her. 

I can’t remember what I said except it was something along the lines of, “Ella puede besar mi culo, Ella no es mierda.”(she can kiss my butt, she ain’t poop;tryna keep this pg.)and “¿quiere patear su culo?” (Want me to kick her butt?) she laughed and than said she wanted to go look at some art stuff. 

I told her to go ahead and I would be right over(I was browsing for a cheap package of socks) 

I was only there for a few moments when I heard my sister shouting. Of course my mama bear instinct kicked in and I ran over cart and all.

Some fat chicana was holding my sisters arm and screaming at her in Spanish. It was something along the lines of how dare you ignore me, etc. etc.

I calmly walked over and asked her to remove her hands from my sister. She did but still was yelling and I put my little sister behind me. 

She claimed she needed help because she couldn’t locate something and hates having to talk in English and saw my little sister and thought she could help. (For context she was wearing a shirt with spanish lyrics to la llorona on it.) so she assumed she could very well speak English and was a Latina.

She than stopped and raised an eyebrow at me and my sister and than quickly started yelling about how she should know Spanish but it makes sense since she’s a dirty mixed child and in English called her a mixed little wh*re. 

She started to cry because she’s sensitive about being screamed at, and generally scared of mad adults.

I’m not gonna lie I have my abuelas temper so I told my sister to start marching out of the aisle. My face felt really hot, I immediately started throwing any random cuss word I could think of at her.

Not limited to but including, “vete al diablo” (go to hell) “chupar una verga” (suck a d*ck) “culo gordo”(fat ass) “Perra estupida”(dumb b*tch) “kaiate(forgot how this is spelled) la boca estupida puta” (translates roughly to shut your mouth you stupid wh*re) and lots of other stuff before finally telling her that if her fat chicana butt wanted help she Gould was got a worker or something because children shouldn’t be your first one you go to. And she huffed and said she would tell the manager about me, I told her to go ahead and next time she wants to harass a child, that she gets hit. 

Good lord. She was entitled and harassing a child who clearly didn’t work there. Honestly might place this to both Reddit forums."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d2lj0n/entitled_karen_thinks_im_a_janitor/,"Entitled Karen thinks i'm a Janitor Now, this happened about seven years ago, and while I DID work in the same building, it was not as a Custodian.

I was about 19 or 20 when I worked in a hospital's Food Service department as a Food Service Aide, and since the hospital was small, we were the only food option available in the building aside from a Vending Machine on the fourth floor. So we had a small cafeteria, and the kitchen was responsible for making food for both the hot line in the cafeteria, and the food for patient rooms. We were always understaffed, and run ragged all the time. I worked as dish washer, a cook in the cafeteria, and during lunch and dinner shifts I delivered food to patient rooms.

Now, because I worked in the Food Service department, I never got mistaken as a custodian thanks to the different uniforms. My department (at the time) wore ugly barf green uniform shirts, black uniform pants, hair nets, a stupid black chef hat, and black shoes. They were so bad, many of the girls were mistaken for guys because of how they were made to fit our bodies. Custodians wore a bright blue polo, black pants and black shoes. Plus, nine times out of ten they had either a cleaning cart with them, or some kind of cleaning supply. Trust me, this is all important.

Now, I was used to getting ordered around by nurses because of diet sheets, and having to deal with irate patients because they were getting beef or chicken broth after surgery. It was all a part of being at the bottom of the totem pole. However, patients or their families were most of the time very nice and happy to see us since we were bringing food. But on this particular day, I was in a pretty foul mood. An entitled nurse was threatening to call my boss if I didn't hand over extra pre-made sandwiches for her and her crew, when she KNOWS we are not allowed to do that. It was late, and I was running behind on serving patients their dinner. I was on my first floor, and was about to go get another food cart to go to the ICU, when I felt a harsh tap on my shoulder.----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cast: Me, K is for Karen, and S is for my Supervisor

K: Ugh, finally! Do you know how long I have been calling the nurses station for you people?!

Me, confused: I'm sorry, were you trying to get a hold of Food Service?

K: No, I've been calling for YOU! Do you know how long I have been waiting for you?!

Back then, I wasn't really very good with people. If anything, I used to run away from conflict. But thanks to this place, I was growing a bit of backbone due to the Bitchy nurse staff. And because she caught me in a bad mood, I probably had a ""Wtf do you want"" look on my face.

Me: I'm... sorry? How can I help you?

K: My *(insert relative here due to HIPPA)* has been waiting for someone to clean their room! I have been paging the nurses station over and over again, but they wont call someone!

I would have felt sorry for her, had she been a bit nicer to me, since I knew this problem rather well. At the time, the nurses of that floor were entitled and horrible. Many had gotten fired for improper care of patients after I left a couple years later, and thankfully the place is much better now. But back then, this was a common complaint. But since she was being an ass to me, I didn't really feel like bullshitting her with a fake smile and taking her complaint seriously. She had the aura about her that screamed, ""I'm better than you haha"" and I personally cannot stand that.

Me: I'm sorry, i'm sure they called for someone. If you wait, i'm sure-

K: NO! I'M NOT WAITING! Get off your lazy ass and do your job!! You serve the public, so you will listen to what I tell you!!

Me: *Realizing what she was talking about.*  Oh, i'm sorry. I'm not a custodian, i'm in Food Service.

K: Stop making excuses and go clean the room, there's pee everywhere!! And while you're at it, get your manager! You suck at your job!!

Me: Ma'am, you need to keep your voice down. I work in **food service**. I will go get someone from-

K: Shut your mouth! How DARE you talk to me like that!! I make much more money than you will ever make in your life!! That means you serve ME! Now do what I tell you!!

I go back and forth with her for a good ten minutes, trying to insist that I don't work as a Janitor, and this prompts my Supervisor to come to the floor. He was wondering why I was taking so long coming back to pick up the cart, and as he comes off the elevator, he sees me with the crazy Karen. I could almost see the urge to turn back and run into the elevator in his eyes, when Karen turns to see him standing there.

K: Are you this guy's manager?! \[I'm a girl... stupid uniform ;-; \]

S: Uhh yeah.. how can I help you?

K: I want him fired! He's lying and saying he wont clean my (*Insert Relative here*) 's room!

Looking confused, Supervisor looks to me as if wanting to know what happened. I look at him and mouth silently, 'Help me, she's insane!' He then looks to Karen.

S: Ma'am, s*he* isn't a custodian. *She's* delivering food trays to very hungry patients, and is not a custodian. Now please keep your voice down or I will call for security.

K: How dare you!! This man has lied to me and tried to assault me!! What the hell kind of place is this?!

S: *She* is a food service aid, who more than likely has to get food for your (*relative*) and other patients. The food is getting cold, so please leave *her* alone to do *her* actual job.

This apparently pissed her off more as she began to yell in his face, and Supervisor told me to go to the kitchen and ask one of the other Aids to finish delivering food.

I found out later that she was escorted off the property, and that she was black-listed by the relative from coming to see them. Turns out she was right outside their room, and they were so embarrassed and angry about her actions, that they told the hospital staff to move them to another room, and to inform security to keep her from coming back to see them. She didn't take this too well, as the cops were called twice afterwards.

**Edit: Holy cow I never thought my post would get so many responses! Thank you everyone. I have more Karen tales to tell, so I may post about them later! :) Also, for those of you who sent me a DM asking to read this for YT, go right ahead! I would love to hear someone read my story. \^\^**"

A brief backstory.  I graduated high school back in 1995 (yes i'm also old), and was heavily into the Drama program at my school.  I was the lighting and sound tech during my years in the program.  I did all the miscellaneous things around the set and was pretty good at my job.   I was reputed to be able to fix anything....even though I only really fixed one thing, just a loose screw on a strobe lamp.  A few years later my former teacher calls me and asks if I could come and help out with the new production.  And the story begins

So the year is 1999 and i'm 4 years out of high school and going right back as a volunteer.  I only had a part time job at the time so had lots of time to help out.  This day found me at the school helping to repair and set up the lighting trees, lights and the sound system.  It was coming up on lunch time and I needed to vacate the cafeteria while the students descended for the feeding frenzy.  I decided to walk down to the McD's, about a half mile from the school.  I left campus by the back gate and proceeded to walk to the golden arches.  I lit up a cigarette and went on my merry way.  There was a chirp of a police siren from behind me when I was about half way there.  This is where it all begins.

O: Yeah, I need you to get in the car and come back with me.

Me: Uuuuummmmm why??? 

O: I caught you smoking and off campus.  Cant have you cutting classes

Me: Oh, I graduated 4 years ago, I'm only volunteering at the school.

O: I heard it all before, now you can either get in the car and take your punishment like a man, or I can cuff you and take you back in cuffs.

Me: Are you serious?  I told you I graduated already....I'm 20.  I have ID.

O: Yeah, yeah, yeah....told you, your choice. \*Reaches for his cuffs\*

Me: Ok ok fine....

I get into the back of the police car and he takes me back to the school.  Straight to the front of the school, in front of all the student who are still on lunch period.  I'm shaking my head the entire time i'm walking to the office.

O: I caught this student smoking and cutting class down the road.

OL: (To Me) Hi Dumdum, (Looks at Officer) uuuuummmmm Officer, he graduated 4 years ago.  Hes a volunteer for the schools Drama program.  He can leave anytime he wants.

O: Are you sure?

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d29yvv/a_christmas_i_dont_work_here/,"A Christmas I Don't Work Here Hello all you happy reddit people! Your friendly Canadian maple leaf here with another story for you!

This is one of our family legends and as Mum was telling it again last night, I thought i would share it with you.

Come with me back ..back..back in time to 1964. Canada had a very famous , and much loved store called Eatons. Eatons was the Canadian answer to Macys and their stores were filled with a high end hodgepodge of clothing and household items. Every year Eatons would host the annual Santa Clause Parade in Toronto. Much like the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, it attracted hundreds of thousands of people filled with holiday joy and hyped up on candy canes and coffee.

Into this happy crowed of merry-makers came my mother with my 2 oldest brothers aged 2 and 3. Mum had gotten to Bay st. a little late so the curb side seats were all taken and the crowd was huge. Not only did my Mum want her little guys to see the parade but she worried about them being crushed in the crowd so she looked around and spied the office tower above the Eaton's store.

Mum took tighter hold of her boy's hands and made her way inside and up the elevator to two or 3 floors above the parade route where she found an office with an open door. All was quiet and there was a beautiful window seat perfect for 2 small boys to perch on to watch for Santa! So Mum pulled up a chair for herself, plopped my brothers on the window ledge and settled in to watch the parade.

Suddenly a very elegant, well dressed lady came into the office and smiled at Mum and my brothers.

Lady - hello!

Mum- OH! We didn't know anyone would be here. The crowds... gesturing to the mob below..we can go..

Lady- Don't you dare! Let the boys see the parade! And saying that she had the young guy with her pull up a chair and she sat and watched the festivities with my Mum and brothers.

They had a wonderful time! Chatting about their families and the parade and all sorts of things.

I was shopping at Ulta today (for the unaware, it’s a beauty retailer) because in the midst of a mental breakdown, dumbass me wanted to shave a slit in my eyebrow, then decided one wasn’t enough, and promptly took a huge chunk out on accident that now needed filling in with brow pencil (that I was conveniently out of). 

So I’m browsing about and walking right past the product I want obliviously (multiple times), mumbling to myself about how I could’ve sworn Benefit would be around here somewhere, when I hear it. 

“Excuse me, where are your Neutrogena products?”

Now I /was/ wearing makeup today for once (usually I look half-dead when I walk into Ulta as I am out of practically everything and thus bare-faced), and I 
/was/ wearing all black (employee uniform colours), but I assumed that my sunglasses, purse slung over my shoulder, and my horribly confused pacing and mumbling would’ve keyed the average spectator in that I was in fact a shopper rather than a shop attendant. 

I looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a fading spray-tan and the classic Karen bob staring at me expectantly. I shuddered as I thought back to all the r/IDontWorkHereLady stories I’ve binged over the past few months, contemplating whether or not I should pretend to be deaf or something to avoid further conversation.  Me being the helpful person I am, however, I simply braced myself as I blurted out “I don’t work here, but I think they should be—”

“—Oh, sorry. Don’t worry about it,” Not-Karen interrupted, turning around and walking off without another word. 

Two words: Bullet. Dodged."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d2aywu/my_selfmedicated_irritability_vs_little_old_man/,"My Self-Medicated Irritability vs Little Old Man Hi folks, mod here. I usually come off as a little unapproachable, so I rarely have stories to post here. My last one was [nacho business](https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/9nh3c6/i_know_what_this_looks_like_but_im_just_here_for/). ;p

But it has happened again. The crimson flame is alight, some poor fool has mistaken me for an employee.

By day, I work in Provider Services for an East-Coast insurance company. Doctors offices call me to consult on patient benefits, go over issues with claims, and sometimes just because they're lonely (this is my working theory, because a lot of calls I get are stupid, but Doctors aren't usually stupid, so clearly it's intentional? >.>;)

My office is right next door to a Walmart, and most of my colleagues and I can be seen dipping over there for lunch, breakfast, or after-work drinks. Sometimes I go there four times a day, it's a problem. I'm on a diet, and I've been trying to be good-- doing it Mediterranean: lean meat, low dairy, high fiber carbs.

But there's a monster on my back. You can call me.. irritable. When I was younger, you'd have called me angry, but now my rage at the world is just a low hum of occasional bouts of irritation. Today is one of them - I woke up feeling kind of salty, and I'm still feeling it. So I'm self medicating with the false dopamine hit of sugar.

To the story: There I am, outside of Walmart with a bag of groceries on my lunch break, digging into a little Cheesecake cup from the Walmart bakery. I'm not wearing a blue vest, my work lanyard is in my back pocket, I'm wearing a very fashy muscle shirt with an asian styled collar, and black jeans. I don't think I look like a walmart employee.

Apparently someone thinks I do, though. This little old guy with a cowboy hat swaggers up to me and announces, ""So they let you take a break, huh!?"" at the top of his lungs, with the timbre of a military drill sergeant. As an anarchist, I'm already SO not there.

I raise an eyebrow after swallowing a mouthful of creamy goodness (once again, title of my sex tape), and reply, ""Not a Walmart employee.""  
He rapidly intrudes in my personal space.

""Look now, I'm a shareholder!"" He drawls at me.  
""Okay...?"" I reply with the dryest of tones, and I can feel a fist forming in the hand not containing cheesecake.

""So-- GET BACK TO WORK!""  
I am now manually controlling my body, so I don't absolutely break this little old guy who is screaming in my face. Fist is slightly vibrating.

Rather than replying, I slowly tilt my head to the side. He looks up at me, and takes a step back, and then turns and walks away briskly.

Nothing too serious happened, the police weren't called, and I finished my snack and walked back to work. But it did change the pitch of my day - now I'm laughing at idiots instead of irritated at my work.

So, in the end-- I'm thankful for that little old jerk."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d23tdj/she_doesnt_work_here_but_i_do/,"She doesn't work here, but *I* do. So, I'm not the one who didn't work there this time, but I don't know if the girl has a Reddit account, I didn't see the story sorting by new and I am involved in this, so here goes.

I'm a bartender at a small restaurant, some hobby nonsense of an old boomer couple, but it keeps the lights on and it's been getting better for a while. It's near the end if the night, around 1:15. The place is DEAD. We have one regular, but nobody else. Most of the staff are looking busy or goofing off, one girl's standing up front, and her little sister's shown up to hang out with her a bit and get some food. She's given her order to her sister up front, but she hasn't sat down, she's just by the front entrance because... Reasons. She wanted her food directly in a box, we don't normally do that, but the employees sometimes take a meal home like that. The actual employee there ducks into the kitchen once they finish their conversation like she couldn't bear to talk to her sister for one more second, and she's gone quite a while.

Then... *They* shows up. 45 minutes before we close. Of course. Why would *They* ever not.

See, we have these two regulars, an old boomer couple we just call *Him* and *Her* (or equivalent) that are extremely awful to deal with. They don't show up often, but they look for any excuse to complain because the husband used to be the owner's pastor and both the owner and his wife think the world of them. Read, they treat the staff like slaves, get free food half the time and never tip.

So, of course, *They* walk right past the girl, sit down, and glare at her. She kinda shrugs back, and *He* gawks for a moment before telling her to ""Get a move on, you aren't off *yet*."" I didn't hear what *She* said to her husband, but I'm guessing something about kids these days. All the young teenager up front did was look around, confused. *He* repeated himself. ""You, are you *high*? Get our menus.""

And she did it. She made that mistake, she got their menus and *then* told them ""I don't work here, I'm just waiting for my order."". Of course, *She* didn't believe her. ""Don't give me that, I see you serving here all the time."". I start making my way over, but the girl tries to explain. ""No, my sister works here, I'm 14."". *He* rolls his eyes. ""Not your sister, you. I'm not blind. I know Ownerswife left early today, but you can't weasel your way out of serving us."" (So, if the 14 and 19 year old look alike, to who is that a compliment, and to who is that an insult?)

This is when I arrive, getting scowls from both of them. They really don't like me. ""Excuse me, this IS Waitressname's little sister. Her big sister is in the kitchen right now getting HER order, and will NOT be serving you tonight."" (I was adamant about that. The way they've treated her before was unacceptable and if I had my way they'd never be back.) ""One of the other servers should be available to take your order, though."".

Quickly, a waiter does arrive take their order, having apparently just noticed what's happening up front. But while *He* was ordering, *She* was being... *Herself*. ""Why do you keep defending her? She's lazy and she can't do her job."" (I don't get a chance to answer, but 1: This is not the same girl. 2: You're unacceptably awful to the girl you're thinking of. 3: I hate you.) About this point, the girl's sister shows up with her box, and quickly hauls her away from *Them*. I was disappointed *She* was only confused, not embarassed. Sge night be incapable of feeling shame. I look *Her* dead in the eyes, and tell her ""Have a nice meal. Bar's closed due to excess paperwork."". I then went to play solitaire. I had no paperwork left, there wasn't much to begin with, I just was not willing to serve *Them* if I could avoid it.

They eat and leave with no further incident, not 5 minutes before we closed. Several staff members had to stay late because of *Them*, and so did I to help out a bit and lock the place up. That's all."

I was dressed in jeans shorts and a tanktop with a sweater, and here's the kicker: *I was lying down in the bed with him.* It was getting late, we were both tired and scared, so I was laying down and holding him.

Cue some random middle-aged lady opening the curtain. She's wearing a patient's gown.

Her: Can you unhook this for me?

Me: \[ignores her, because I didn't see her, and there's been tons of noise outside our curtain for a while\]

Her: Hey! Can you unhook this for me?

Me: \[looks up, sees her gesturing to her IV\] Umm... no? I don't work here.

Her: Oh. I guess I'll find someone else \[turns to leave, then turns back\]. Unless you know how to do this?

Me: No.

Like, I was in jeans shorts, laying down in a bed cuddling someone behind a closed curtain, and her first thought was that I MUST work there. It makes me really concerned for what she thinks nurses actually do."

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d29f50/awkward_encounter_at_the_costume_store/,"Awkward encounter at the costume store This is the first time I've ever been confused for another employee anywhere outside of my work, but it was kinda underwhelming compared to some of the more sensational stories I've read lurking here. I'm still gonna share this here since it fits:

Okay, so I work at a car dealership and keep the company's Facebook page scheduled with regular posts to promote the business. I don't drive myself to work, and instead take rides from my parents to and from. I honestly really like my job, and it's a great way to loosen up from the usual tensions of daily life.

So one day, less than a week ago, my mom picked me up before going around the city for some window shopping. We were hanging out in this plaza before I decided to walk into the costume store to see if there was any props or accessories to improve my plague doctor costume for Halloween (The one from my misadventures at the special needs karaoke night). 

Just to point it out, my work uniform was a black polo shirt with my business's logo on the front, with some khakis and work shoes. The employees at this costume store also happened to have black polos for their uniforms.

... Which inevitably led to an African American woman (not a Karen, thank Christ) asking me where I could find the plates. I just told her that I didn't work here, and she quickly apologized and went on her way.

Not even five minutes later, it happens again. A second African-American woman, a little bit more heavy-set than the first one, and in a group with the woman from before, is yelling in my direction while I'm waiting for my mom and sister to finish at the checkout.

ME= Minecraft Enderman
PK= Possible Karen (I don't like to judge by first glance)

PK: Hey you, what do you think you're doing!? Get back over to the register!

It took me a bit to realize she was talking to me, but when I spotted her,  I walked over just to see what she wanted.

ME: (Already suspecting she's a Karen) What?

PK: Get back to the register, I need to check out so I can leave!

I wasn't too fond of her rudeness, so I just wanted her out of my face.

ME: (in the most passive-aggressive tone I can manage without drawing attention to myself) Look, miss. I've dealt with this same issue from another woman not even five minutes ago, I don't work at this costume store. 

ME: (gesturing to my own uniform) I work at the car dealership, a ways down from here. See the logo?

PK: (steps back in a moment of clarity, and then turns beet-red) Oh my God, I'm so sorry!

She left me alone without an argument, amazingly. I've been lurking around r/entitledparents, r/insaneparents, and this sub long enough for me to recognize a Karen, but this one didn't seem like an actual encounter. I've never witnessed one in person, luckily.

Again, this post is kinda anticlimactic, but I figured I'd put it here anyway."

Frankly enormous pile of shoes and says, ""I'm so sorry you have to clean up after people who make a mess. I promise it wasn't me."" Like super sincerely too. And I pause for a second trying to process words and then was like... ""I know it wasn't you, it was me! I'm done trying them on so I'm cleaning up my own mess."" Oh my. This lady goes red in the face and ducks away quick going ""Crap.... She don't work here.""

Edit: I wasn't actually done shopping and neither was she so the rest of the time I'd pass her, she'd look at me as if to ask me something and then go... ""Wait no, you still don't work here""

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d1sbse/woman_threatens_to_have_me_fired_from_a_store_i/,"Woman threatens to have me fired from a store I don't work at It finally happened to me, and I'm apologizing now because I'm a mobile user. You know the drill.

For some context, I work at a pretty popular grocery store in the Midwest that's based out of Iowa. Now when I say popular, I mean popular. The town I live in voted this grocery store as the BEST grocery store in the county for the 3 year in a row, and this store opened in 2015. My uniform consist of a red polo with the company name embroidered in white, black dress pants and black shoes. Now to the story.

This happened last night, I had just gotten off work, was still in my work uniform on my way home when I realized I forgot to get groceries after I clocked out. Instead of turning around to go back to the store, I decided to stop by Walmart since it was on the way back to my apartment and I only needed two things. I go into Walmart, pretty tired from my 9 hour shift (I work in a floral department and since it's homecoming season I spent my entire shift wrapping flowers and making corsages n all that fun stuff. It was very busy that day) and go to look for some bread to make French Toast in the morning. I'm standing in front of the bakery looking for the right type of bread for a few minutes when I felt a tap on my shoulder and someone sighing heavily. 

When I turned around I saw her; Karen. She had the haircut, the makeup, the everything.

Me: ""can I help you?""

Karen: ""I've been standing here for MINUTES waiting for you to help me and you're just looking at bread! You are terrible at your job! Now help me find the toilet paper.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I don't work here. I work at a different store down the road. I'm just a customer.""

Karen: She pauses for a second and looks at my shirt before huffing in my direction. ""You're lying! That store would never have someone like *you* working for them. Take me to the toilet paper now!""

Me: At this point I'm starting to lose my patience. It's been a long day and I really did not want to deal with her attitude. ""Ma'mm, if I did work here, why would I be wearing the uniform of their number one competitor in town?""

Karen: ""So you can get away with being a piece of lazy trash at work but I wont stand for that! I'm getting your manager!""

Me: ""whatever lady."" 

Karen storms off with her cart and I carry on with my shopping I grab the bread I needed and a gallon of milk. I'm about to go to a checkout lane when I see Karen come barreling toward me with a manager in tow. 

Karen: ""Her! This is the worker who is being very rude and isn't doing her job. Fire her!""

The manager gives me a confused look, noticing my polo that has the company name of the store I work at.

Manager: ""Ma'am, this girl doesn't work here. I've never seen her before, and I know all the workers on my night crew. And it's pretty obvious that she doesn't work here considering she has a polo for another grocery store""

Karen: ""you both are LIARS! Is this how you treat your paying customers?! I'm NEVER shopping here AGAIN!"" 

The wild Karen storms off and the manager apologizes to me for the trouble and ended up giving my two groceries to me for free considering what just happened. The only reason I'm posting this now is because this morning before I went to my college classes I stopped by my store to cash a check at customer service and I told my coworker about the story. The best part about this story? I had a feeling in my gut and asked to see the list of banned customers for our store. Guess who's picture was at top of the list? Karen. 

Apparently there were three recorded times where she left carts of frozen or cold products in front of the restaurant connected to the store containing HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PRODUCT FOR HOURS, and then just leave the store without paying for it. I'm talking about expensive steaks, crab legs, lobster, large cheesecakes, milk etc. All of this product had to be thrown away because it was no longer safe for consumption. After the third time of this happening, she was banned from my store. 

I guess I'm lucky. Even though she knows where I work, she can't legally enter the store.


Edit: fixing some grammar issues

Edit 2: Fixed more grammar and spelling issues I didn't notice when I was on my phone and wanted to clear up some questions. Because of the handbook policies, the store I work at is very strict on what is posted about them by workers on social media. For that reason, I cannot say *exactly* what store I work at but I will say that some of you have guessed it. Also, as I said this store is based out of Iowa, but the store I work at is in Illinois. :)

Someone asked if we informed Walmart about what had happened in the past with Karen and the answer is yes. After I told my coworker the story what happened at Walmart and said that it was in fact Karen, she made a call to the same Walmart to tell them what happened. I wasn't around for the phone call since I had to leave for a class, but I'm guessing that she will also be banned from that store as well.

Some of you suggest that she was going to dumpster dive afterwords to get the groceries that we had to throw away. This would be impossible as the trash shoot is sealed off, and can only be open with a key on garbage day for the garbage trucks. Same goes with the cardboard compactor. 
Thank you all for the upvotes and the award, I was not expecting anyone to ever read this. Also if rSlash ever reads this, give Yugo a pat on the head for me, will ya?


TL;DR: lady mistakes me for Walmart employee, threatens to get me fired, then yells at both me and the manager for lying to her and storms out of the store. Turns out she was banned from the store I actually work at."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d28uew/im_the_lady_who_mistook_a_dumbstruck_customer/,"Im the Lady who Mistook a Dumbstruck Customer Apparently I’m one of the many people without a brain and actually thought I found a  a worker, but was ACTUALLY a customer. This is actually true, and I’m making this after it happened yesterday. So I’m on mobile. Just to give you a heads up.

I had a very big project to do for a special one and i had absolutely NO sleep for two days. Maybe a little bit, but I’m still not entirely awake and practically a walking zombie. My mom helped me out with it by taking me to my favorite place to get a lot of supplies. I’ll give you a hint. It rhymes with “Bobby Jobby”.

I walked in, well, wobbled in cause I’m still half asleep. Mom close behind and both of us talking about crap. We needed to find paper, glue, and whatever was on the list. We got through the list and I just wanted to leave so I could rest, or finish the project. Mom was looking for fairy lights and we found some, just not the ones we needed. 

Now the thing with mom is that..shes a bit stubborn. We’re looking for something in a store and she cant find it. I always tell her to ask, but she always says “Im fine!”.  Nothing bad. Just too stubborn.. I’m the one to ask and would either get an answer, or embarrass myself cause I asked someone who couldn’t understand my wacky description of what we’re looking for. 

So the employees, from what I’ve seen, wear a blue shirt and some khaki pants. Well apparently, one of the customers was wearing the same colored shirt, but not a name badge, or anything. So mom went off to who knows where and I saw her literally picking up one if the metal decorations to look at. But me being a dumb butt thought she was stocking. I walked over to her while thinking of what to say cause I have a problem speaking clearly. 

Cast:

C-Confused, and probably worried customer.

Me- A dummy who needs glasses.

Mom- My mom

Me: Once I get close, I smiled and asked in a nicer tone. “Scuse me?”

C: She looked up at me confused. “Yes?”

Me: “I hope its okay to ask since your in a different department, but can you help us find some fairy lights? We need ones that change colors?” I kept talking even tho it looked like she was trying to interrupt me. 

C: Looking a little flustered, “Im sorry, I don’t work here.” 

And after that, my face went completely red. I was now practically whispering “Im so sorry!” Over and over again. She smiled and assured that it was okay, tho I might’ve spooked her a bit. I ran around the store to the front, both trying to find my mom, and trying to stay away from her for awkward reasons. 

Me: Mom found me and I mumbled under my breath, “Apparently, some people like to wear the same colored shirt at a store with employees wearing that colored shirt...” 

Mom: She smiled and gave me a comforting side hug, “Its okay, baby. That happens a lot.” 

Thats why theres this lovely sight. Now, I may have said it like she was at fault, but in reality, I was an idiot, and she wore what she wanted, so I shouldn’t have said, or thought that, but try going through three days with no sleep. 

Thats my story. I might not ever ask anymore since I hate talking to people in public, and now completely embarrassed for mistaking someone who doesn’t work at some store, doesn’t help at all, either. Hopefully I wont be an idiot next time, or mom needs to not be more understanding and less stubborn."

So I worked at a Guest Services for a mall and in our mall we had a Wal-Mart. I would go to Wal-Mart on my breaks or after work sometimes to grab a few things and almost every time someone would mistake me for an employee. I had a name tag on that clearly says the mall name and I wore all black with no vest in sight but people see a tag and assume you have to work there.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d21zuj/thats_a_different_bicycle_rental_place/,"That's a different bicycle rental place Hello everyone,

It is some time ago that I posted something, but I hope you like this one.

One day I was transporting bicycles from storage to our shop. Almost next to our shop, is another bicycle shop, just 3 houses over yonder. Note: we (from company A) wore red clothes, and the employees of the other shop (company B) wore yellow clothes.

After I was done unloading our bicycles and renting out some, I saw it was nearly time for coffee (15:30). Some times, if there is time, we meet with the employees of B to share coffee. I made enough coffee for us 3 at A and the other 2 at B. I walk towards their shop with coffee for B, they happily accept, we talk a little and they need to help some clients.

And then, as a roaring thunder, a lady walks up with her bicycle in hand. EL = entitled lady,

To me EL: CAN I speak to your MANAGER? This is unacceptable!

Me: what is the problem?

EL: the bicycle is broken, the gears don't work!

Me: okay, if you wait a minute, the other two guys will help you

EL: why don't you?

Me: I work at company A next door

EL: but  you can fix my bike?

Me: yes I can, if you rent a bicycle at company A, otherwise it will cost you

EL: I don't care, you look like you work here

Me pointing at my red sweater and then the yellow ones of company B

EL: yeah, so you are the manager? Do you treat all customers like that?

Me: ma'am, I work next door

EL: Just fix my bicycle!

Me: okay then

Me fixing the gears, took about 2 minutes

Me: that will be 15 Euros please 

EL: for what? I rented a bike from you, so the repairs are free.

Me: well, I still work nextdoor at company A, but if you wait a minute.

Me running to A, made an invoice for adjusting gears, run back and give it to her.

EL: oh... So you really work at A?

Me: yes lady. So, are you going to pay your invoice?

She eventually gave me 5 Euros for the miscommunication instead of my joke invoice (if maintenance takes less than 5 minutes, I'll do it mostly for free, if you're nice). The employees of company B laughed their balls of. Especially, because they were finished by a long shot and just grinned at me through most of the conversation with EL. 

I really liked this one. Sidenote: one of the two employees at B used to work at A and has learned the business from me, and he knows me as the supervisor/manager there, and his best moments were when I was annoying the annoying clients.

Hope you liked the story, let me know what you think. And let me know if you'd like another story from the bicycle business."

Me: For your dog?  
Old Man: Yes the vet said I should try it.  
Me: Does she have dry skin or something?  
Old Man: No I just like to keep her clean and give her baths, she likes baths.  
Me: You know that can dry out her skin.  
Old Man: Yes thats why the vet said baby shampoo.  


Okay so we've come full circle. I tell him again I dont know about here but walmart would sure have it in their baby section. I then tell him I dont know much about human shampoos but know a bit about dog shampoos as I'm a dog groomer.  


He looks surprised and we start talking about his dog and my dog. He says he takes her to a nearby park and she is so small that she'll stop to smell where all the other dogs have pee'd on the side of the paths and get all messy with pee on her feet and legs. I tell him he might try dog wipes/baby wet wipes. And use those for a quick wipe down to get the pee off and that it worked for my old dog when she would pee on herself.   


We then showed each other pictures of our dogs and then started to talk about where I work and he also asks me if I know anything about hawks flying off with dogs. I tell him its really the only super small dogs like chihuahuas, yorkies and malteses that would be able to be lifted off the ground. (he had a min pin, pretty good size, 13 pounds) He then tells me he would feel so awful if that happened to her so he stands outside for her to finish going potty. He then says she is the only family he has left. His wife passed away last December from a very serious illness that cost him 24/7 care for her. He said everything else around him started falling apart like his house. He needs to get it fixed up. It's just him and his dog.   


I said I'm sorry and started feeling bad for him, I told him he reminded me a lot of my grandpa (in looks and his mannerism)  He then joked and was like how old is that? I told him in his 60's and he was like oh good, i was hoping you wouldnt say 70's. I then told him my grandpa plays poker and if he did, he only plays it online not in person so it probably wouldnt suit him. I then tell him he also owns property and fixes it up for his residents and thats when he tells me about the state of his house. He goes on to say retirement has him getting quite bored from owning a business to doing nothing. I tell him thats how my grandpa was too with owning computer stores to then retiring and not feeling it so he stated his buying and renting out property. He understood that.  (at this point i'm just trying to get him a social life with people his own age, dont know if my grandpa would be too keen on it but if the guy played poker irl then maybe a new poker buddy)   


After talking for quite a bit in this tiny isle with everyone going around us (sorry people) he then says that he has to buy dog food shortly and his vet told him a brand, i tell him to be careful as some brands people are finding bugs in them when they open them and maybe a wet dog food would be better than the bags. He was shocked but thanked me for the warning and then said if he see's me he'll say hi. He gave me his name and I gave him mine. He then asks if maybe some time I might want to go get coffee and just chat.  I'm a bit hesitant mostly cause i dont drink coffee and he sees this and goes of course you dont have to i'm sure your busy with your boyfriend. I just laugh and tell him no. When then part ways and i start thinking to myself he's just lonely. He has no family left and its just him and his dog. I'm probably one of the few people he's had an actual conversation with in a while.   


It then reminded me of retirement homes that my great grandpa was in before he passed. We all would constantly go over to visit him. My family told me that the old folks in homes like this lots of times their families will just put them here and forget about them. That makes me said to think about.  It made me sad to think that this old guy has no one left and is just all alone with his dog as his only companion. I wouldnt mind taking him up on his offer if it meant he just needed human company for a bit.   


So yeah, not a horrible story. Just a sad one and it all started with asking if I knew where the baby shampoo was."

Our name tags are the rectangle magnets with the rounded corners, white background, our name and the Y logo.  These name tags, unfortunately, are quite similar to the Shell gas station name tags, except for the different logo.  Shell, of course, also has a completely different color set for their shirts.

On my way home yesterday from helping another YMCA with some training on a new system, I needed to stop at a Shell gas station to fill up.  In our state, it's illegal to pump your own gas, so I pull into a lane, wait to get assisted and proceed to get out of my car to grab something quick from the convenient store attached.  Little did I know that wearing a name tag automatically makes me an employee.

As soon as I get out of my car, some lady gets in my face and proceeds to yell at the top of her lungs:

Lady: ""OH MY GOD.  THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST SERVICE EVER.  I HAVE BEEN WAITING 3 MINUTES FOR HELP AND HERE YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF YOUR OWN CAR FIRST.  YOU ARE THEIR MANAGER... YOU SHOULD BE HAVING THEM HELP ME!""

Me: ""Uh, I'm sorry, but I actually don't work here.  I'm just grabbing some...""

Lady: ""DON'T YOU DARE TRY TO COME UP WITH AN EXCUSE!  GIVE ME YOUR NAME AND NUMBER SO I CAN FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST YOUR LOCATION!""

Me: ""Well, if you would stop yelling at me, you can find my name on my name tag and also see that I don't work here, so if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go grab a snack and drink now.  Have a lovely day!""

Lady: ""DON'T YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME... I AM A PAYING CUST...""

Attendant: ""Ma'am, I have been waiting for the last two minutes to assist you.  If you could please stop yelling at our customers, I can get you filled up and on your way.""

On my way out, the attendant and I had a good laugh and he gave me a $10 gift card for my troubles."

So many many years ago I did a stint with a retail store as a salesperson. (I hated it) Anyways the nearby mall food court often claimed our time because it was so close to our retail site we could walk to the mall for lunch break. 

Anyways, it was near Mother's Day or something like that so me and another salesman were in a greeting card store trying to find a card for our wives. Cue Karen.

I feel a tap on my shoulder. ""Excuse me""

Now please understand that I am in dress pants, long sleeve white shirt and red tie. The only thing that even remotely made me look like I worked there was the name tag on my shirt that read the NAME OF MY STORE and my name.

""Yes, Ma'am."" I responded.

""What time is it?"" but it was in the tone of a demand. Not pleasant in the least. Anyone could have come to the same conclusion that she was definitely expecting an answer and I had better snap to it.

I look at my watch for a second peeping out from under my long sleeve dress shirt. I acted like I was reading the watch and the fire back with ""It's is exactly ... time for you to get a watch.""

I walk down the row of cards as I notice her walk to the front of the building in a huff.

After taking a few more minutes to select a card, I head to the front where Karen has corralled the manager over to the side, is pointing at me and gesturing to my name tag. I can't make out what she is saying until I get closer but it ends with the emphasized word, ""...fired!""

The poor manager looks at me rolls his eyes and says ""Ma'am. He doesn't work here."" 

I immediately un-clip my name tag and pocket it in case she wants to look at it again. A few seconds later the young lady behind the counter finished my purchase as she smiles a little extra with the words, ""Have a nice day sir.""

""You too.""

I waited till Karen was looking and then said ""Have a nice day ma'am"" mimicking the young lady behind the counter. Karen's eyes narrowed and her internal temperature increased to critical. The manager tried to hide a smile."

Rental company: ""Hi Joshua,
The guest who has the reservation has been able to get it for Saturday to Saturday before.  She is wondering if the owner would be willing to let her have it again for 2019.""

Me: ""Well I just talked to Roger and I don't think that's going to work. They're having a ""goblin stomper"" that week at the property.

Totally sleep deprived, but the money was nice until you just didn’t care about it any more. Then the local phone company publishes my number in the yellow pages as the number for the local dairy.  Do you know what time stores start calling the dairy to order milk in the mornings? Usually between 4 and 5 am, right about the time I was just getting to sleep good. After the first few calls, it began to sink in that this wasn’t just a fluke, so I called the phone company and found out what had happened. Not much they could do really, I guess, my number was out there and the calls kept coming...  This went on for weeks. Finally out of sheer desperation I started taking orders for milk. “Eight gallons of whole, four gallons of skim and four quarts of buttermilk? Yes, ma’am.” It didn’t take just too much of this before the word got out and the calls finally quit coming in."

On to the story: I live in a large European city and like many large European cities, summer holiday time is when all sorts of big maintenance works are carried out so that commuters are inconvenienced as little as possible.

I didn't go on holidays. 

I was in a medium interchange station between commuter rail, suburban busses and the metro. This station has a direkt link to the airport with suburban rail, but that was cut due to mentioned maintenance works and now instead of a direct link there were three train changes and a ride on a replacement bus service. The metro did take you to the airport with one change of lines.

In comes Kevin. A pretty scuffed up young guy, pretty nervous and apparently on such a tight budget that €10 broke the bank.

Don't travel without some petty cash for unforseens, kids!

Anyway, I was loading a ticket onto my public transport card from the vending machines and this guy walks up to me and starts asking how to get to the airport. No ""excuse me"", no ""do you speak English""... Just a ""what's the fastest way to the airport!?"" 

Anyway, I tell him that the quickest will be a taxi he can get outside of the building.

Oh no, that won't do! That's so expensive!

So while I was still feeling helpful I tell him that the metro goes there with one change of line.

That was fine with our man, so how does he get on the metro? By touching your transport card with a valid ticket at the turnstile!

He waves some paper ticket from the railway company in my general direction saying that they told him that was good to go to the airport. I tell him that the metro is not the railway and he'll need another ticket. Does he have a public transport card? No!

So, since I was still by the vending machine and I was still feeling helpful, I punched in all the options to buy a public transport card, with a ticket to the airport. Grand total a little over €8, because the airport has a surcharge.

Oh, no! No! No! That's too expensive.

I stopped feeling helpful. ""Look, I don't work for anybody here. I don't set prices. I'm just enjoying my weekend and I tried to be helpful and now you're raising your voice on me. I'm not being treated like this. You see how you get on.""

I made a quick turn to the turnstiles, touched my card and got in.

Kev went on screaming profanities behind me and I just flipped him off as I descended on the escalators to the platform.

Before anyone asks, I didn't get into the service cuts on the railroad and replacement services with this guy, because even I didn't fully understand it."

Years ago, while I was working at a high school, we had secretary in our janitorial department. Nepotism ran rampant in the school (the secretary was married to the day foreman, and their college kids worked summers), but they were all great workers so that's beside the point. Point is, I met her daughter a few times in the summer, but not enough to get to know her at all.   

Anyway, I'm off of work one night and at a pool hall with my friend, sufficiently drunk, and I stumble over to the attractive girl I thought was my waitress. 

Me: I'd like to pay our check

Her: ... um. Hey, you're Erich, right?

Me: Oh fuck, you're [secretary's] daughter, I'm so sorry. I thought you were the... I'm going now. 

So, the next morning at work I thought it was just a stupid story, and tell the secretary:

Me: So, I ran into [daughter] last night and thought she was my waitress, silly me. I guess I recognized her but was too tipsy to realize from where

Secretary: Yeah, she told me her boyfriend broke up with her because of some random guy coming up an talking to her. 

We share a very awkward laugh.

It's my first real post on here, I've been lurking for quite a while, but never posted. So my apologies if the formatting is wrong.

This happened yesterday in my local supermarket.

the cast: LoL: Lovely old Lady, K: Entitled Karen, M: Manager, CE: Confused Employee, and ofcourse Me as me.

I'm a fairly tall guy (1,97m, or about 6'5""-ish) and I get asked to grab something off a top shelf by someone shorter than me on quite a regular basis, and when I see someone struggeling to reach a product, I often offer to help myself. So ofcourse when I saw this little old lady, all streched out and standing on her toes, trying to reach for a pack of crisps, I asked: ""Do you need some help Ma'am?""

LoL: ""Oh yes dear, if you can grab me 2 packs of those crisps, that would be wonderful""

Me: ""No problem, here you are"" \*hands her 2 packs of crisps\*

The LoL then starts about how I remind her of her grandson, because he's tall as well, and he also wears those kind of ""music shirts"" (I'm wearing a shirt with the skull of the whispered one, from [/critical role](https://www.reddit.com/r/criticalrole/), but I choose not to correct her on that one.) We keep chatting for about 5 minutes, and during this time the Karen of this story pops her head in the isle 2 or 3 times and looks in our general direction. I didn't think anything about it... yet...

So after about 5 minutes, the LoL thanks me again, and she goes her own way. Time for me to choose what kind of crisps I want. Nope.

K: ""are you FINALLY done talking? I've been waiting for 15 minutes! What do you think your boss would say about wasting 15 minutes talking to a costumer?!""

me, confused: ""Uhmmm... I'm pretty sure he doesn't care whom I talk to?""

K: ""you're trying to tell me he doesn't mind you wasting time?""

Me: ""yeah... and even if he would mind, I don't see how it would be any of his business.""

K: ""Nonesense! Anyway, I need \[BRAND X\] Coffee beans.""

me, still oblivious to the fact she thinks I'm an employee: ""As far as I know all coffee is in the next isle, I'm sure you'll find it there""

K: ""I know it's in the next isle you idiot, but the shelf where it's supposed to be is empty""

me: ""Well sorry, can't help you then."" And I turn around looking at the crisps again.

K: ""That's it! I will have your job for this!""

It's not untill now I realise she thinks I'm an employee there, even though I'm wearing a black shirt with a skull on it, and the employees wear a light blue button up shirt with a nametag. I wanted to explain to her that I do infact not work there, and this must be a misunderstanding, but she's already storming off.

I continue shopping, and a few mintues later, when I'm standing at the Dairy section next to an actual employee who's stocking, I hear her shouting again

K: ""That one, that's him!""

M walks to CE next to me and asks him: ""This lady tells me you've been wasting 15 minutes just making small talk to a custumer, and then you refused to help her. Can you tell me what happened?""

CE: ""Eh... no, that's not true. I did help someone find the grated cheese, but then I went right back to stocking""

K: ""No! Not him! the other one!"" and points at me.

M, looking at me and then to K: ""Ma'am, this is obviously not an employee here""

Me: ""No, how the fuck did you think I was an employee? I obviously don't look like one""

K: ""And now he's swearing at costumers too! YOU NEED TO FIRE HIM!""

I just facepalm at this moment, then look the manager in the eyes and say: ""You know what. No need to fire me. I quit effective immediatly"" I then turn to the CE, who's failing to understand what's going on and say: ""It was nice working with you mate, see you later."" And shake his hand.

I could see all 3 trying to figure out what just happened when I walked past them to checkout, and I couldn't stop laughing on my 3 minutes walk home."

I make it up to a cashier, I make small talk as i'm always kind to them- I've been there!

Full story:
I just found this community. My story happened nearly a decade ago, and isn't extraordinary, but it was very satisfying.  Exact wording is a little iffy thanks to a poor memory, but it's a close approximation. 

Around this time in my life, I worked retail. I was regularly mistaken for an employee of various stores, even if I wasn't in clothing that even remotely resembles a store's uniform. I must have had a customer service aura or something. I don't know. My friend too. 

It's also not uncommon for customers to knowingly ask other customers for assistance in the area I live in. It's an ""I know you don't work here, but was hoping you could help"" kind of thing.

So, a friend and I were at a mall, browsing a small bookstore.  We both loved reading all kinds of stuff. Fantasy and Science Fiction, actual science, history,  comics, travel,  hobbies, even the occasional trashy romance novel. You name it, and one of us has probably read a book that falls under the category.  I mean, we both just *loved* reading pretty much *anything*.  We were also both very familiar with our local bookstores in general.  Browsing at bookstores was one of our favorite pastimes. 

We'd been in the store for about 30 minutes or so, moving from section to section and talking in low voices about various books, authors, and series with enthusiasm and excitement. We were also discussing which ones we wanted to buy, and had baskets with us. We were pulling books off shelves, reading the back, flipping through the first few pages, and reshelving the books we didn't decide to buy.

It's important to note that both of us were dressed extremely casual. She had on a very low cut shirt, and I was in jeans and tank top that showed a bit of cleavage. Definitely not the professional attire that the bookstore employees wore.

We'd just reached the comic section, when this lady came up to us and interrupted our conversation with a question about a specific book. The only employee apparent in the store was in the process of ringing up several customers. 

I asked her what the book was about, and after she told me, I told her what section it would probably be in and pointed the section out. Then I turned back to my friend and resumed our conversation. 

Well, this lady didn't like my response and was not going to have it. She interrupted us again, and asked why I wasn't looking the book up on a computer and escorting her to it's exact spot on the shelf.  

I said ""Sorry, Ma'am. I don't actually work here. I'm just another customer, who happens to love books. I'd still take you to it, but I've never heard of the book you're asking about. What I told you before is the best help I can offer. ""

I then turned back to my friend and resumed the conversation. Suddenly this lady grabbed my wrist.  I turned towards her in total shock and outrage, and my friend is giving her a murderous 'WTF do you think you're doing you crazy lady"" kind of look. My friend had gone from kneeling near the bottom shelves to standing in an instant. 

I calmly looked down at her hand and then looked her in the eye as I gently but firmly removed her hand from my wrist.  Then I stepped back out of arm's reach.

Lady: "" I know you work here.""

Me: ""How dare you touch me like that. I'd think that the way we're dressed would make it obvious that we don't work here. ""

Lady: ""I've been in here for 15 minutes and you two have been moving from section to section while talking about books. You work here!""

Me: ""No. I don't."" 

Lady: ""Yes you do. I saw you putting books back.""

My friend, who is much less polite than I am: ""You saw us doing all of that because we love to read, and we were looking at books, you fucking idiot."" (It's possible that her response had several more F-bombs. At that time, fuck was my friend's favorite word, and she sometimes used it every other word. I enjoyed the word myself, but customer service was so ingrained in me that I most likely stuck to purely polite language. )

Her: (Offended and outraged) ""I'm going to report you to your manager.""

Me: (smiling and laughing a little) ""Ok. You do that.""  

Lady: (While looking me in the eye) ""I mean it.""

My friend: (also laughing) ""Go ahead.""

I turned and exchanged a glance with my friend before we both turned back to watch her.

The actual bookstore employee was less than 10 feet away and well within hearing range. My friend and I were eagerly awaiting her complaint. 

When she got to the actual employee, we were thrilled to hear her recounting the tale of how rude we were to her, and how we should be fired. 

The employee looked confused, and then looked where the lady was pointing. The lady looked over at us too. I smiled and waved. My friend laughed. 

""No, Ma'am. They don't work here.""

Lady: ""But they've been moving from section to section and talking about books!""

Employee: ""I'm sorry for the confusion ma'am, but they don't work here. All employees of [bookstore] wear a badge like this."" (Shows badge)

Lady: ""But... but... but... They were talking about books and they were *excited*!""

Employee: ""They don't work here ma'am.""

The lady turned toward us looking extremely confused, embarrassed and deflated. ""But....""

I was laughing pretty hard, and making no attempt to hide it, but I did wave at her again. 

Employee: ""What was the name of the book you were looking for ma'am and I'll help you find it.""

The lady bought a single book. Between my friend and I, we bought around 20 or so books. (I had worked a book 'allowance' into my monthly budget.) The lady was gone when we checked out, and the employee apologized to us for the inconvenience.  I told her that it really wasn't her fault that some people are idiots, and we all kind of chuckled about how ridiculous she'd been. 

To this day, I can't get over how impossible she found it that someone who didn't work in a bookstore might know about books and be excited about them. I mean, I might love reading, and read from a broad range of categories, but I've never considered myself as falling into hardcore territory. Sadly, I do live in the southern United States, so ""them readers"" is also a phrase that I'm familiar with. She just didn't look like the kind of people that I'd heard it from. Guess you really can't judge a book by it's cover."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d1513z/accusing_me_of_crimes_because_you_want_to_rule/,"Accusing me of crimes because you want to rule the police? So  I'm the son of a police officer, and I usually go on a ride along with  them once every few years, this time however, I decided to go on a ride  along with one of the officers from the next town over. I've grown up  with the average opinions of cops as a teenager, then as an adult,  ranging from ""they are just thugs beating on innocent people"" to ""holy  hell that guy was 100% guilty"" while having minimal info on both kinds  of events. In recent years as I get older, I begin to have a much more  moderate opinion, especially after what happened on this ride along. I  am NOT a police officer.

I live in  Connecticut, and it might surprise people to know that we aren't  exactly a state filled with rich people everywhere. There are shitty  towns, shitty areas in towns, or just generally shitty people  everywhere. This is a story about a shitty area in an otherwise average  town, unfortunately the heroin crisis was at its worst by this time.

A  bit more backstory on this event, this town is known for some of its  seasonal events like most new england seaside towns, as such we usually  get a lot of tourists from out of state/states or visitors from other  parts of the state. This time however, we got someone who was just petty  enough, narcissistic enough, arrogant enough, and entitled enough to  cause a near international incident..

I  was finishing the paperwork I needed to get the ride along, introduced  myself to the first officer, and talked with him for a bit, while he  finished his starting protocols for the day (checking email, checking to  see if he's been left any messages, looking into the current ""recent  incidents"" folks). All in all, it was like being with my family member  again. He told me the day was going to be a little bit longer because a  few people he got called to the week before, called his number to follow  up on an incident (a callback). While he was doing this, I offered to  pick us up some car friendly lunch, from a sub place I really loved.  Little did I know, I was about to be followed by one of the worst human  beings I've ever encountered in my life....and I've met a homicidal  necrophiliac pedophile maniac. [for context if you're brave enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bcu5ja/police_officers_of_reddit_what_is_the/ekucghd/?context=3).

I'm  wading through this nightmare traffic to get to the sub shop, then I  decide to just park at my friends house so I can walk the rest of the  way (town is rather close and easy to walk in). I get to the shop and  order their special for the week, get some snacks and drinks, then walk  out the door and into nightmare lady by accident, I apologized and asked  if she was alright, she told me she was fine with one of the most  monotone voices I've ever heard. I thought maybe she didn't get her  coffee or something, and just got in my car and was about to head back  to the station. While I was putting the subs into one bag and re-using  an old beverage tray I got from mcdonalds to hold the drinks, I see in  my rear view mirror the nightmare lady taking pictures of my car with  her phone. I am a bit dumbfounded about this and grab all the stuff to  get going, I didn't feel like doing anything to escalate things on what  was pretty much a perfect weather day.

I  get inside, grab my stuff and walk with the officer to the car he was  using, we get in and do the basic log in shit for his system....when the  perfect weather day turned to dark and dangerous clouds in the form of  the nightmare lady. I'm sitting in the passenger side seat when this  maniac began smashing her hand on the window and screeching like a  banshee about how she's going to expose the web of corrupt police in the  country starting with us. My first thought was this woman has been in a  serious accident and was hallucinating, because her words were thick  with what I thought were slurred tones, turns out she was just from  Norway and had a pretty good grasp on the english language but with a  thick accent (we didn't find this out until later).

The  officer got out of the vehicle and politely asked her to cease her  assault on the car, she launched into an even more violent tirade and  began to shout how she was going to fix the problems with our country by  replacing all the police with volunteers from europe. This continued  for another thirty seconds before she began taking a dozen more  pictures, after she was done, she grabbed a hand full of dirt and threw  it at him...bad mistake number one for her, he moved in to try and  arrest her, but she got away in her car which was on the other side of  the gate. He radio's it in and lets people know there might be someone  with a head injury driving an \[insert car description here\] and she is  wearing \[insert extremely expensive clothing here\]. The plates came back  as a rental car, and having more pressing issues to deal with (the  callback), he asked if someone else could be assigned to look for this  woman. We get going and meet up with his callback, he talks with them  for a while and informs me on what's happening while he files a report.  It wasn't until he looked in his rear view mirror that he noticed  something alarming, the same woman who assaulted the car was at the  callbacks house and asking them questions while she has her phone out  recording everything. This person has no idea what was going on, and  thought the woman was a reporter trying to do a case on the uptick in  crime in her area.

The officer  goes blues and tunes, spins the car right around and tries to get to her  before she could get away, unfortunately she got away again by getting  lost in the traffic (some dipshits on the road don't think you should  pull to the side when emergency vehicles are on sirens and lights and  cause problems). For the rest of the day, it was pretty mundane. Until  we got back to the station and see the nightmare lady going full  ballistic with a reporter by her side. She then saw me and the officer I  was with, made a straight shot beeline to me and began to shout  obscenities I have never thought possible from another human being. She  kept insisting how I assaulted her and then raped her in the bathroom of  a very public sub shop, listed off a fake name for me and told the  reporter everything with tears down her face. She kept talking about how  she was being stalked for weeks by me and my fellow officers as she  walks home from work.

\[**I need to re-state, I am NOT a police officer and never have been nor will be**\]

At  this point the reporter immediately asks me what I have to say to these  accusations and when the trial will be, the first words out of my mouth  were ""I am not a police officer, I never have been and never will be,  what the hell is going on?"". This enrages nightmare lady, she then pulls  out her phone and presents the most painfully edited video I have ever  heard or seen in my life. the audio didn't even sound consistent, in one  case I could hear my voice cut then copy pasted and repeated three  times for the same three words, and I saw the most cheesy filter effect  ever, being used to ""show"" the officer ""attempting"" to damage the phone.

When  all was said and done, she looked like she got me and had the deepest  shit grin I had ever seen in my life. I turned to the reporter and said  that not only is everything she said false, but that I have multiple  witnesses and numerous videos to prove it. The nightmare lady  immediately stepped in front of me and with a straight face said  ""nothing you have will hold up in court, the police are not trusted and  all evidence will be thrown out, you might as well admit to the crime  you committed"" When I asked what the hell she was talking about she  launched into this whole rant about how the lot cameras were obviously  fake and that police are not treated as a trusted source for courts, it  was her word and her ""evidence"" against mine.

THEEEEN  things got good, the reporter cut her off and stated that not only are  the cameras in the lot REAL, and ALWAYS running, but that the officer  who was with me was wearing a body cam. Realizing her massive massive  massive mistake, she attempted to snatch the camera off of the officers  body, BIG FUCKING MISTAKE NUMBER TWO. As not only did she manage to grab  it and attempt to destroy it by throwing it against the wall, but she  then tried to kick him in the nutz and run away....this went over as  well as eating a lead salami, she brought her foot up and got it  completely trapped by the officer just moving his leg to the side, he  then began to arrest her and read her rights.

During  all of this, she was screaming police brutality, demanding the reporter  only show the part of her being pinned down and arrested, and how the  reporter hast to only release HER version of the story.

It  turns out nightmare was a 19 year old representative from a non-profit  organization based in norway which tries to offer aid to prisoners who  are unjustly imprisoned world wide, it's a genuinely good organization  and I've donated to them before...but nightmare seems to think she's a  big member with huge overreaching authority. Her justification for all  of this, is that she thought I was a corrupt officer because I didn't  hold the door open for her when I left with my hands full.

I  found out much later on that she unwittingly confessed to the attorney  from the non-profit how it was all made up and she wanted to get her  name in the organization so she could ""take over the local police"" and  ""fix them"". She was the delusional daughter of a rather radical activist  from the 80's in norway and was basically a spoiled rich brat who  didn't think consequences applied to her. The organization distanced  themselves from her, and I still donate to them because they do damned  good work.

&#x200B;

EDIT - Freaking awesome of someone to pass me on some sweet silver. Also wanted to mention, the original draft for this would have made that XXXXL go across the page, honestly I just didn't want it to be a boring read. It reads to be more exciting than I intended it to, though it's not an exaggeration, pretty much everything was mundane, even when he arrested her, it wasn't a long or exciting incident...was over so fast that I didn't really register until I thought back on it."

Not the first time I've been mistaken for an employee. Walking around in my work clothes makes me look more professional than the average person, I guess.


But this encounter stood out a bit more to me.


It was last Monday and Hurricane Dorian was on the minds of everyone at our Florida Wal-Mart. The gf and I were picking up some supplies because, well, you just never know.


We had separated and I was walking towards the water section. As I passed by the medicine section I heard ""Sir! Excuse me, sir!"" I stopped and this lady asked me why the pharmacy was closed, when the signs said it was supposed to be open until 9 o'clock.


She took a minute, now that I was in front of her, to get a better look at me. Perhaps it was the lack of a navy blue vest and nametag that clued her in. 

But I think it might have been my flip-flops and my G.I.Joe t-shirt.


Either way, she added ""... You don't work here, do you?""


I responded with ""No ma'am. But I think the pharmacy is closed because it's Labor Day.""


Whether she was satisfied with that answer or she wanted to talk to a *real* employee, I couldn't say. But she quickly disappeared after that."

On this particular day I was there after work, just sort of browsing. I was in the TV section. I'm also still in my uniform from work, complete with name tag. 

A woman walks up to me as I'm looking at one of the TVs and asks:

Women: ""What can you tell me about this TV?"". 

Without skipping a beat, I tell here all there was to know. Refresh rate, resolution, true blacks, recommendations of smart app programs, the works. It was conversational to me.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d18pp9/a_nice_i_dont_work_here_lady_story/,"A nice I don’t work here lady story. Ok so many moons in my past I was am Army Reservist and to celebrate 100years of the Reserve forces the Army threw several Military Tattoos. The one most local to me is held in a University City (this fact is important later) and I get the slightly boring job of marshalling a car park with 5 other guys, helping people park and then providing directions up to the event. We have radios with enough range just to cover the car park area. We take turns directing people to spaces and on the entrance. A few hours pass and the light starts to fade myself and two others are at the entrance and suddenly hear screaming;

“Help!! Help Police!! I’m being mugged!!” In a African accent (Kenya, Nigeria if memory works)

We all run to her aid and the mugger runs off with her bag, the two guys I was with took after him. One, let’s call him Dave, is fast. Greased Lightening on 20 red bull fast. This is wearing drill boots too. I get sporadic radio commentary and a description of the guy as I see to the lady who was attacked.

I walk her to where we had set up at the car park entrance, with a Land Rover and table and such, offer her a drink of water and so on. I whip out my trusty note book and start taking details off her. All the time she’s calling me sir, officer and so on. I brush it off as that’s what she does in her home country.

I get all the info I can and when the others who wandering around the car park turn up she calms down and feels rather safe. I pull out my phone and call the police. She looked at me as if it was weird not to use my radio. Anyway police send some guys over and as they arrive Speedy Dave and Soldier B turn up with the mugger, who a bit battered and bruised. “He tripped, several times” was the answer. (Yes, tripped...we believe you, thousands don’t Dave).

Now by this point the lady is rather confused and couldn’t figure out why, us in our standard issue British Army uniform where handing over to these people in black and white. A police officer speaks to her explaining she’s a police constable from local station. To which the mugged lady replies “Wait you are police, not these men in the combat clothes?” 

Cop: “No, they are Army attending an event in the city.”

ML turns to us and says; “I am so sorry for dragging you into this. I thought you where policemen as in my country they wear Army clothes like yours.”

The lady thought we were the Police. She’d only been there a week and hadn’t seen a police officer in the UK before. But it all worked out in the end.

TL:DR Lady from another country got mugged and mistakes Army Reserves for police officers as police where she’s from wear army camouflage. Mugger apprehend too, after he fell over... a lot."

Home base is downtown, and the furthest dock we pickup and dropoff at is occasionally occupied by small cruise ships. It takes about 10 minutes to get between the two locations if there are no other stops, but we don't exclusively service the cruise ships. We also pickup and dropoff virtually anywhere in between. We run on a schedule; departing downtown on the hour, departing the dock near the cruise ship at half past.
For some crazy reason, the cruise ship passengers frequently think their all inclusive cruise includes water taxi rides downtown. I frequently had to explain that I don't work for the cruise ship and we charge $3 + tip per person each way (which means I have to argue with the same old dilapidated Karens both ways as they always try to argue that they already paid on the way downtown and shouldn't have even had to pay then). The only time I can remember ever received a tip from a crusty cruise ship Karen was when one crumpled $5 and threw it at me exclaiming, ""You obviously need this more than I do!"" I replied, ""I probably do need it more than you. Thank you. Now I'm halfway to my goal of paying for my next meal at Wendy's."" My regular customers got a kick out of that, and tipped handsomely.
One day, I was transporting the captain of one of the cruise ships. We got to talking about how awful his passengers were to me. The end result of the conversation was that the cruise ship would launch their own tender and shuttle their own passengers for free. All of my coworkers rejoiced when they saw the cruise ship's own tender putting across the harbor."

From that day on, I would frequently be mistaken for a manager in pretty much any kind of store I went into, if I went there after work, without a jacket on. I had people come up to me in bookstores, supermarkets, clothing stores, and even a video game shop once. 

Most people were understanding. I only ever had an issue once with this very lovely Chinese exchange student, who wanted help finding 'ludo' in the supermarket. He couldn't seem to grasp that I didn't work there, so I just wound up helping him. Turned out he wanted 'noodles'.

N.B. Before anyone turns around and calls me a racist, I must specify - I have ADHD and related hearing difficulties. Even strong regional English accents can be extremely hard for me to parse.

So one day my bf and I decided to go to Atlanta on a Saturday to have fun because we had nothing else to do. We go to a strip called Little 5 Points just walk around, shop and have a little fun.

We stay there most of the day basically and decide to leave since it was so late but we wanted to go get some cookies. There's a place called Insomnia cookies that's on the same strip and it is amazing. We try to go there every time we see one. 

We got into our car cause we parked pretty far from the strip cause who wants to pay for parking? So we drive to the area where Insomnia cookies but the place is so packed so we're looking for a parking space so we can get out of the car, go in the cookie place and leave to go home. 

There's a parking lot right across from the place and we drive into it (I forgot to mention that my bf is the on driving and not me, also I have a typical kia soul). As he's driving, really slow in the parking lot a man comes up and opens our back door and my bf floors it, mistakenly having the door hit the dude's nuts. (I'm sorry this is hilarious while I'm typing this)  The man starts cussing at him saying ""yeah I just wanted to tell you THANK YOU FOR JAMMING YOUR DOOR IN MY FUCKING NUTS!"" My bf apologized for it and told him we're not an uber. I was honestly scared cause I didn't know wtf was happening then plus he was drunk so who knows. 

The man was saying why would a uber even do that and I'm just like in my head we're not an beer driver. Well not anymore because it started getting creepy for me. My bf then starts just look scared and I was saying how its okay, he just didn't know that we're not an uber. My bf was explaining to me how he got scared and thought someone was trying to rob us and he sped off. 

We eventually drove away and found a parking spot, got our cookies and went back home. My bf and I still get a laugh out of it whenever we bring it up. But still feel pretty bad about hitting the dude's junk.

Many years ago, back when cell phone cameras were still a new concept, I was getting married. Without a lot of money for a wedding, I was planning the ceremony myself, and drove to all the craft stores in my area to find affordable inspiration. 

I had a system for keeping the ideas organized so I could come back to the right stores and find the items later. This involved taking a picture of the item right above the price tag, and then jotting down in a note book what I could use it for. I would also write the code for the photo above the note so I wouldn't get mixed up. 

After discovering how pricy craft stores are, I decided to try my luck at Wal-Mart. They have craft supplies, right? 

So there I was, minding my own business, snapping a picture and writing in my notebook, when an employee walked up to me and said, ""Ma'am, are you doing price comparisons right now?"" 

I nodded and said yes, and started to explain my system, thinking this was just a friendly person I was going to have a chat with. 

The employee held up her hand. ""I don't need to know all that. You can't take pictures of the prices. You can write them down, but if you keep taking pictures, I will kick you out of the store.""

My mouth dropped open. That escalated quickly. There had to be a mistake. I asked, ""but how will I remember what the item looked like?"" 

She shook her head. ""Not my problem if you have a bad memory. Put the camera away."" And she turned on her heel to march off. 

So I had a dilemma. I couldn't plan a wedding with no pictures, but I couldn't take pictures of the prices. Okay, I would just take a picture of the item without the price and include the price in my notes. 

I wrote everything down first, just in case she threw me out before I got all the info, and then snapped the picture. Sure enough, she rounded the corner of the shelf where she had been hiding and said, ""I said no pictures!"" 
I stood still and replied, ""I didn't take a picture of the price, ma'am. You can see it if you want.""

""I don't care. You're leaving now."" 

Just then another employee walked up. I don't know who she was, but the other employee immediately went meek. 

Nice employee: ""What's the trouble here?""

Angry employee: ""She's using a camera phone to do price comparisons.""

I spoke up and said, ""I stopped taking pictures of the price like she asked, but I'm planning my own wedding to save money, and I need pictures to know which things go well together.""

Nice employee: ""So you don't work for another store? These are for your own personal use?"" 

I nodded and said ""Yes, I can't afford a big wedding, so I'm doing everything myself. I just need ideas and places to get things for cheap.""

I briefly showed her my notebook and a couple of the pictures I had taken.

The nice employee nodded like she was impressed and said ""that's a great idea. I should have done that too. Weddings are too expensive."" She then turned to the other lady and said, ""She's fine, come on, I could use you over here."" 

I said thank you and the nice employee said, ""Not at all. Congratulations."" And led the other woman away sulking and silent.

I'll just say the normal stuff now, I'm on mobile and this is my first time posting instead of lurking. Alright, let's get on with the story.

So this happened a  while back, cant remember specific dates, but this is still hilarious to me.

Heres some backstory : I work for a family business as a cleaner, obvious from the title, and clean stuff like banks, fire damages, houses, flood damages, etc. This night I was cleaning a daily bank I do, well, daily. Also, I am 13 years old, but, puberty hit me like a truck, and, I am on the heavier and tall side, so people assume I am either 16, 17, or 18, so I guess I could see why she think I worked there? I've had a fair share of people not knowing that I dont work FOR the bank, and they were usually polite. But none were like this Karen.

So I was vacuuming the drive thru area at the time of the occurance, playing music because it helps me get through the work. The drive thru leads to a one way, so when I see people coming up, I naturally assume they are going to go to the one way. So, j glanced at her for a second, then realized she was waiting and trying to get my attention. Luckily, I know how those microphones that they use work (it was literally just an on/off switch, I'm a genius, I know.), so, I turned it on and asked how I could help her. (She was right next to the glass, and she was loud and proud, so I could hear her very clear) The following conversation goes like this. M = Me. K = Karen.

M : Hey, what I can I help you with? 

K : I'm here to deposit a check. (Lowkey dunno anything abt banking, plus it was a while ago so I forgot exactly why she was there.)

M : Oh, ma'am, I dont work for the bank, I am just a cleaner.

K : Well I dont care what you're job title is, just do your job!

M : I am doing my job, cleaning... 

K : Ugh, you people are so annoying!

M : Ma'am, if you dont believe me that I dont work here and am just a cleaner, please, walk up to where it shows what times the actual bank is open. (The bank was closed obviously)

K : No! I will not go until you give me my money!

M : Look, theres an atm round back of here, go over there, I cant help you. 

K : I shouldn't even be here, I deserve free money for dealing with your dumbass!

M : So you want a cleaner to give you free money for them doing their job? Good logic.

K : That's it, I'm calling your employer! 

M : Alright, feel free to call my phone or my dad's, either one works. (Its a family business, that's why I said that)

K : I'm done with your bullshit! I'm coming inside!

At this point I was scared to high heaven, I forgot whether or not I locked the door, so I ran as fast as I could to the door, thank god she was slow. She then proceeded to try to bang on the glass when I told her I wasnt letting her in. The times they open and close are to the left of the door, she looks at the times, and I see her face change. 

K : Oh. (without making a sound, she proceeds to walk back to her car and go on the one way)

That was probably the best time, even till now, that I've had cleaning at the bank.

Tl;dr : Crazy karen wanted me, a cleaner, to cash in a check, then demanded money, tried to get me fired, and went ballistic when I told her I didnt work for the bank and am just a cleaner.

So, just a disclaimer, she was older, was in a nursing home(probably), and I'm not sure what she has. The old lady had huge ulsers on her legs, I was told. This isn't a Karen story so if you wanted something satisfying this is not the post. I was not there because my sibling was at work and that would be incredibly unprofessional.

So my sibling is a caregiver for more elderly people and took one of their clients to a nursing home so the client could visit a relative. 

Now let's meet the cast: F:sibling OL:Old lady 

So my sibling was walking back with a nurse at the nursing home and OL wheeled out and saw my sibling. She had huge ulsers on her legs and when was frail. 

OL: Miss? Can you take me to my room?

F: Of course.

My sibling takes OL to her room carefully and when they got to the room OL turned to my sibling.

OL: Can you put me to bed?

Now my sibling has not done a full body move for a little over a year and my sibling does not work in this care facility. Nor is qualified in the slightest to do so. 

F: No I dont work here.

OL: Why?

F: I dont work here. But I can get a nurse to help you.

OL: You dont work here?

F: No. But I can get someone who does to help you.

OL: That would be lovely dear.

And my sibling did and the old lady was apparently really nice and got their client home safely.

Sorry again that this wasn't a Karen story. Boy do I want Karen stories but they honestly terrify me."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d0dvmx/silencing_the_auto_departments_least_favorite/,"Silencing the Auto Departments least favorite customer Hey, it's me again!  My last post blew up so I figured I'd post about something that happened a couple days ago.

&#x200B;

Backstory: I used to work in the Automotive section of a Walmart in my city.  I have since left and found a job that I enjoy more than I ever did there.  Management was nice, coworkers were nice, Customers were hell.  On this day I encountered one of them and unleashed a tirade against her.  Sorry to anyone on YouTube who considers using this, there's a LOT of swearing here(Mostly on my behalf).

&#x200B;

Cast is as follows: Me - Me, Cathy - The customer(Not her real name), Employee - Some employee I don't know, Jim - My former manager(Those who read my last post know how cool he is.  Not his real name)

&#x200B;

So I went to Walmart to get my oil changed, as I've done since I began working there.  They've got a fair rate, and they're very careful, so I figured I'd drop in, see my old coworkers, do some minor shopping, and get my oil change done at the same time.  I was wearing a black shirt, a black and grey flannel and blue jeans, my usual 'out of work' outfit.  I was standing there talking to the Employee about some meaningless things while waiting on my oil change when Cathy turned up, red faced and clearly annoyed.

Cathy: What the hell does that worthless technician want now?!

It dawns on me that I recognize her voice, but I can't really place it.  The employee then tells her the note that was made for her vehicle.  The note?  A brake light being on prior to service, which meant that they wouldn't work on her vehicle AT ALL, per store policy.  Cathy explodes.

Cathy: Are you fucking kidding me?!  I have a trip coming up and I need my fucking tires changed, and this place is the cheapest place to get the fucking tires!  Get me your manager, I'm going to have your fucking job and that sleazy Tech's job too!

Suddenly, I remember her.  When I worked there we had a woman come in wanting to get a hole in a tire fixed.  I was the one tasked with the job, and upon removing her tire I noticed rubber sand inside her tire.  For those who don't know, that's not a good thing.  The tire had clearly been driven on while it was flat, way too much for it to be safe to drive on any further.  When I told her this myself she had a similar reaction, and Jim was called in and asked what was going on, so I had been blunt.  I told her that if she continued to drive on that tire, which also had an indent on the sidewall, there was a risk of it exploding while she was driving, which could potentially lead to a crash that could injure or kill someone if it wasn't replaced.  She bought a new tire that day, thanks to my scare tactics.  But, that's not this story, this is me unleashing my rage on her.

&#x200B;

I would like to also point out that this woman was a regular in this department.  She always asked for cheap oil, and then threw a fit when we used the exact oil suggested for her car, She got pissy with us when we told her that our full service oil change excluded coolant, brake fluid, brake work and A/C things, Told us all we were 'worthless mechanics that wouldn't get far in life', things of that nature.  Essentially, she killed every one of us inside every time that she came in, which was fairly often just for the final point to be hit every time.

&#x200B;

The employee reaches for the phone and I wave him off, making him blink.

Me: Sorry bud, I used to work here, and I went to school for this thing-

Cathy: I don't fucking care!  My breaks squeal a little, so fucking what?!

It's at this moment I hear her car being backed out.  The squeal from her brakes was loud even with the door being closed.  I take a deep breath.

Me: Okay, so you need new brake pads and more than likely a simple top off of brake fluid to deal with the light.  However, that's not the point.  You're berating someone who had nothing to do with this entire fucking mess all because you're dealing with an inconvenience that your stupid ass could have prevented?  He won't tell you how he feels, nor will the techs out there who do their best every single day to make sure people's cars are working so that they're fucking safe when they drive, but me?!  I don't give a flying fuck anymore and will gladly tell you how I feel!  When I was here, when you'd come in, we all HATED you!  You tore us down while all we did was our fucking jobs, while we worked hard to keep people safe on the shitty roads in this dumpsterfire of a fucking town, and you have the gall to bitch about something that is YOUR fault?!  These guys work hard because they love what they do, not because they're going to sit there and please every 'holier than thou' assclown who decides they have nothing better to do than break them down every fucking time they have a bad day!  If you want a fucking manager go find one, because I know damn well they're all sick and tired of your bullshit, and I'm pretty sure that after harassing the guys that work here they'd tell you never to fucking return, you stupid, entitled bitch!

This is the simplified version.  I chewed her out for a good five minutes, and I used some more creative expressions just because I was sick of her shit.  While this was going on, Jim was coming down because his own vehicle was being worked on, and he was checking it.

Jim: Whoa, OP!  Calm down man, last time you yelled at someone I took a punch!  What's going on...(His voice trailed off as he saw Cathy, which made him actually frown and scowl).  You.  We banned you after you shattered a customer's window during your last visit.  Employee, call the police.  OP, would you mind blocking that door?(He pointed to the ""Employees Only"" door, and I nodded).

&#x200B;

Cathy was arrested for trespassing, as they'd put a restraining order on her, and I felt the mood in the shop change as soon as they saw her being escorted out, at which point I waved to a few of my old coworkers, paid for my oil change and my items and walked out, watching Cathy resisting arrest and being tased all the while.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Crazy lady got tased after I chewed her out int he Walmart she was banned from.

&#x200B;

Have a great day you guys!

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d0cxol/no_not_her_i_work_here/,"No, not her, I work here The gym teacher story just reminded me of this. I actually did work at the school, but the student involved obviously didn't. 

I work at a school as a yard aid and I had this one eighth grader who looked much older than she actually was. Like, I legit had mistaken her for a parent a couple of times (new clothes, on the far side of the yard, or just when not looking directly at her).

One day she was having a bad day and was on independent study (no class for her that day) and so she came to me to talk. I also had to cover the office, so I was standing in the doorway (to watch both the office and the yard) so she sat at the main desk, as it was right next to the door. 

A parent came in and I asked if she needed help. She said no, and pushed by me and just started angrily talking to my student, she needs such and such from the principal and wants to set up a meeting for her daughter blah blah blah, in a really condescending manner. Honestly, some of it was some pretty sensitive information too. 

I was kinda shocked,  so I smiled at the kid who had a bit of a deer in the headlights look. To her credit, she quickly looked around the desk and grabbed a stack of post its and pen and just started taking notes. 

Finally the parent asked, rudely, did you get all that? 

The kid said ""Yep, I'll get that to the principal when she's in. But honestly I don't think you should go around asking students for help with these things.""

The mom got real quiet and was like, ""wait what?""

So I intervened and said, ""You should probably get back to studying kid. I'll handle it from here. ""

The kid got out quick (good instincts on that one) and the mom started to get angry at me. 

""How could you let me do that, I'm so embarrassed!""

I still thought this was just a funny mistake, so I just reminded her that I had asked if she needed any help. She chose to tell the random stranger, as opposed to the staff member. 

She left in a huff, so I texted the principal to get ahead of it. The principal just texted me back with ""That's hilarious."""
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/d060p5/gym_teacher_mistakes_my_mom_a_staff_member_as_a/,"Gym teacher mistakes my mom, a staff member, as a student. So this happened a few years ago when I was still in high school. I'm not sure if this exactly fits here, but we'll just go with it.

My family lives in a city in Wisconsin, a pretty nice city with fairly good schools, never really have too big of problems.My mom had started working in the school district while I was in middle school, she works with kids with disabilities, as she has experience, being that my brother has severe autism.She first worked at the elementary school before working at one of the middle schools, before finally moving to the high school, despite her not wanting to.

My mom does not look her age, she's turning 39 in a few weeks. Around the time of this story, she was probably around 36. Her height reaches into the early 5 foot range, with two of her kids towering over her, and her daughter just about to be taller as well.At the time, her hair was cut rather short, like, just past the ears I'd say. She wears contacts, due to her vision. She dresses with a lot of geeky material, with shirts ranging from Star Wars all the way to Labyrinth. Typically, she looks quite like a normal high school student, even today.

On to the story.

This happened during her first year working at the high school, and since I wasn't there myself, I'm only roughly explaining what happened.

On this day in particular, one of her contacts had broken, and seeing how bad her vision would be without them, she had to wear her glasses to work, despite the fact that she hates doing this.As well as this, she wore a black Labyrinth shirt (It was basically the poster of the movie plastered onto a shirt) which was partially covered up by a black open up cotton shirt with long sleeves. She had dark tight jeans on with just some normal shoes.The only way to tell that she worked there was the lanyard with her ID on it, hanging from her neck.

It was just after Lunch if I recall, and my mom was tasked to walk with one of the kids she looks after. I don't recall what this kid had, but he loved to talk about movies with my mom constantly. He would have headphones on while walking and would be looking at his Chromebook the whole time.My mom and the boy were walking down the hall near the high school's upper gym. She did this from time to time while kids were in classes, so he could get around and move, as he did not like doing much work.While walking, they were far down the hall, about to turn a corner, when out of no where, someone had yelled down the hall at them.

(GT for Gym Teacher, M for Mom, we'll call the boy ""Frank"")

GT: Hey, get back to class!M, thinking this teacher was yelling at some other student wandering the halls, continued walking slowly with the kid.GT: (Obviously sounding annoyed) Don't make me have to write you up for wandering the halls.M now turns around to look towards the talking. She sees GT standing at the doors of the upper gym, staring dead at her.

GT was known for being quite... annoying, to say the least. I had her once in my last year. Thankfully, I got on her good side for the most part.She's in her late 40's to early 50's, usually wears thin sweatshirts with tight pants, and athletic shoes. Her hair is cut into a Beatles style, dark like the Beatles hair as well. She stood quite a few inches taller than M, but not by too much.

M looks around, confused at first.GT: Don't just stand there all dumbfounded like that. Get. To. Class. (She purposefully exaggerated the last few words).M has been mistaken for a student on multiple occasions, but only when she's usually wandering the halls alone, not when she's with a kid.M: Oh, sorry, I'm walking with Frank here, he likes it when the halls are quiet.GT: He can walk with a teacher, you don't need to babysit him when you have classes to go to.M: (Still a bit confused, but realizing the situation) Sorry, but you're mistaken. I'm a staff member here. (She goes to show her the ID)GT: Nice try, come to my office so I can write you up.At this point, the teacher turns to start walking into the gym.M doesn't listen and continues walking.

This was apparently not the right move to make.

GT: Don't you DARE walk away from me, you come here NOW so I can write you up!At this point, GT started storming it over to M. To which M quickly turns around and flashes her ID to GT.M: Ma'am, I work here.GT stopped inches from the ID and stares at it for a moment, before going pure white. She backs up and clears her throat.GT: You should be careful how you dress, people are going to think you're a student.M: Right, I have to get back to work now, maybe you should too.

At this point, GT walked back to the gym doors, closing them fairly loudly behind her.Frank had continued walking ahead of M, so she quickly caught up to him and kept on with her day.

My mom and I had quite a good laugh on the drive home from school.

&#x200B;

Side note: My mom still works at the high school today, and has gotten to know quite a lot of the teachers there. She's only had a few encounters with GT since, and it seems GT didn't even remember seeing her that day, or just refuses to acknowledge she mistook a staff member for a student. Either way, win for my mom."

When i got there, i realized that some subscription had taken my 1.50 eur or something, so i could not take money out.

I posted here yesterday, but despite getting awarded silver and having nearly 1k upvotes (96%), it was taken down and I don't know why.  I can only assume that one of the moderators doesn't believe I work with adults with disabilities such as autism.  Unfortunately, any proof I could provide would reveal my clients and therefore violate HIPPA laws.  So, I figure the only way to remedy this is with more stories.

TLDR at the bottom.

Same background as last time.  I work with adults with autism and other disabilities, I help them get jobs and keep jobs.  One of my clients works in the lobby of a fast food restaurant we will call, WacArnold's.  Now this story occurred on election day.  To be clear, this story has nothing to do with politics. 

My client had come back about 10 minutes late from his 15 minute break.  This is something that occurs regularly, and we were working on fixing it.  I was talking to him about it.  I was being a bit stern as this problem had been going on for months and WacArnold's was only going to look the other way for so long.  I finish talking to my client and get him started on the second half of his day when ""Liam with a Y"" enters (Because he looked like the kind of person that would actively introduce himself as ""Liam with a Y"").  This wannabee Chad looking fellow will henceforth be known as LY. 

LY (looking outraged and sounding quite condescending): Hello, I don't like the way you just spoke to your employee.  Is there a manager above you I can speak to?

Me: Not really, since I don't work for WacArnold's but I can give my boss's number, if you'd like?

LY (looking confused): Huh?

Me: I don't work for WacArnold's.  I work for (REDACTED) I'm essentially a job coach for the disabled.

LY (unsure whether he should still be outraged): So, he's like... your client?

Me: I can't technically answer that directly, but I am here working with a client.

LY: (this suddenly clicked for him and his attitude, undertone, and overall body language completely shifts... his entire state of mind shifts) That must be a tough job.  I'm glad there are people out there who have that kind of patients.  Thank you for what you're doing.  It's heroic work.

Me: (my turn to look confused)  Uhhh... You're welcome?

LY: You have a great day!  Keep up the good work!

Me:  Thanks?  ... You too?

That's when he left.  I was completely dumbfounded.  Apparently, the way I spoke was absolutely terrible if I was a manager of your local WacArnold's, but since I work with the disabled, the way I spoke made me a hero?  I literally stood there for minutes trying to figure out what had just happened.  I wanna say that he slowly thought about it and came around to my side, but no.  This was an instantaneous change.  He went full circle in his attitude in under 10 seconds.   
 This is one of my favorite interactions I've had with someone who thought I worked for WacArnold's, simply because of the turn around.  That instantaneous shift from ""you're horrible and that was abuse"" to ""OMG, you're a hero for just doing your job"" always makes me laugh.  

I want to assume that this guy meant well, but based on his age, attitude, cell phone usage, and a few other smaller things he said and did while there, I unfortunately believe that he was more out for internet points than the protection of my client.  He was just waiting to post about how he had called out WacArnold's for mistreating the disabled on every platform he was a part of.  

Liam with a Y, if you're reading this, I hope I'm wrong and I hope you do realize that real-life karma is more important than internet karma.

TLDR:  Young Male Karen thinks the way I talked to my client was abusive if I worked for WacArnold's.  Learns what I actually do for work and suddenly I'm a God-sent Hero of justice."

I stood near the escalators in a large department store reading the list of items on the floors, when a Danny de Vito type of man approached me rapidly shouting “Pots!” in my face. I looked down to him quite puzzled as he impatiently repeated “Pots!”

Wearing street clothes including some sort of Barbour jacket I certainly didn’t look like I worked there, and his rude tone annoyed me: “I beg your pardon?” “Do you have pots?” This time he almost barked at me, so I gave him an annoyed look together with my most condescending tone: “Of course I have pots!”

“Where?” he yelled. Setting one foot on the escalator I spoke down to him over my shoulder: “In my kitchen cabinets, where else!” and rode up."

now for the start of the story. i get the game, and then realized, i needed to apply updates and such.  and we didn't have internet at the house for the moment, so i told my mom i was gonna use the Walmart WiFi to update it. she agreed, and i walked around with her.

i started to notice the WiFi was strong in some areas, and nonexistent in some. so i found where it was strongest, and that was right next to the changing room, i think it was. i tell my mom ill catch up with once i was finished, and she went on with shopping. i was leaning against the wall, watching that bar go down.

then a person walked around the corner, and tapped my shoulder, which scared me. i don't remember what she said, but i did say ""i don't work here, sorry"" given how anxious and shy i was, i was able to say this to her, and she was so embarrassed. she did ask what i was doing, and i told her what i was doing, and she left me very kindly.

once again, i'm sorry this wasn't a post of some wild Karen or something, but i feel like any moment like this is a moment to be remembered. i told my mom and she quietly told me not to say that, just in case she was around. i do wish sometimes i could have an encounter like that, and then post it here.

I heard some commotion in the next isle and the common phrase ""I will have you fired"" along with some stuttering. I looked over and lo and behold this lady around the age of 30 or so was yelling at a poor 19 year old.
She was berating him on what tires she should get. A was in a full freaking subway uniform and technically he worked at Wal-Mart but at the restaurant attached to it, not in the auto department! So I went ahead and used a technique I learned on this sub Reddit and stepped in between A and K.

 I filled my lungs with air and use my loud, fast and annoying voice to tear her a new.
""HOW DARE YOU BERATE A CUSTOMER LIKE THAT, YOU AS AN EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE MORE RESPECTFUL TO US PATRONS AND LEARN SOME SELF-RESPECT! WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER I WANT TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THIS COMPANY AND I MIGHT EVEN WANT TO CALL THE POLICE AND HAVE YOU ARRESTED ON TWO ACCOUNTS OF ABUSE AND DISTURBANCE OF PEACE!..."" So on ade so forth. All the while I have my hand behind by back signalling to A too GTFO. He take the hint and get out of sight. K looks mad that someone talked to her like that and tried to put pressure on me but backed off when she saw my assortment of throwing knives, ( I had 3 sets of 3 knives per set) and got the heck away. My mom heard the commotion and knew it was me but by the time she got there I was already comforting A who was about to have a panic attack. After he calms down we exchange info and 8 months later were inseparable. I even gave him a set of knives from my collection and taught him how to use them to defend himself and how to better control his fear.
 
 Turns out the reason for his PTSD is the fact his dad and sister died in a car accident when he survived and his mother blamed him For it even though he was 9 when it happened. He told me how much his mother hurt him over the years and how entitled she was( yes he is the son of an entitled parent, but made it out ok) I'm just glad that I helped him in that situation, it could've ended a lot worse. At least I got a new friend who has disabilities like me( minor autism and ADHD with some anger issues) and even a new person to discuss swordsmanship with( hobby of mine, reason for all my knives) and a good story. I hope you enjoyed peace!☮


Edit: I happened to get lucky and got the rare smart Karen, who ran away when she saw my knives... The rarity of them is like a chansy in the safari.

Edit 2: people are arguing about why I have knives at Wal-Mart, every Thursday a group of my friends and I get together to practice and brag about our new blades... I had bought three new sets of knives( the sets in the story) and I later went to Walmart and forgot they were on my belt until I saw Karen back off and realized that I still had them. As for the set I gave A, that set was a three-year old duplicate set( I had two copies of the set) so I gave one to him."

When he started high school, both of our parents were working so I joined him at what’s called freshmen roundup.  Usually a few days before the school year begins, the classes come to the school for registration paperwork, student ID’s, photos, yearbook, etc.  The freshmen who come alone tend to get egged on hazed in some way so most either came with parents or older siblings.

She looks at him and realizes that he, and about a dozen students around us, are fighting back hysterical laughter. My brother can’t contain it and let’s out a loud laugh. A few other follow. I’m angrily glaring at her while she’s looking around. She just looks at me with this stupid expression and walks away.

Nephew: oh

Me:  (nephew’s name) he doesn’t work here.

Nephew then goes up to Customer 2 who was behind me in line ,,chuckling a little.

Nephew: you find me A gummies pwease?

Customer 2: Sorry little guy, I don’t work here either.

Nephew: oh okay.

Customer 3, (looks slightly confused)

 The next day before going home I remembered that I needed to get groceries. I stop at the target and start my shopping. This older lady (a Karen) was yelling at this poor girl(April) about being a bad employee and how she should be fired. April kept telling her ""I dont work here"" while attempting to walk away.

Here is where I come in. I walk up to them and ask ""what's going on here?"" 
Karen:this dumb bitch of an employee isnt helping me!

April: I-

I interrupt with ""I dont care what your trying to do it's my day off and your making work as usual. take this paper and meet me in the break room!""(while giving a wink to make it even obvious to April that I'm just putting on a show)

April: (playing along)  you know what?! Fuck you and fuck this job! I quit fat ass!

Karen thanks me and she asks me""where are the pop tarts? "" 

I point her to where they have the tools she thanks me.I run to the Starbucks and meet up with April.

she says""how in the fuck did u come up with that? And thanks for the help!"" 

I reply with ""first lemme buy you starbucks, and I used to do roleplay online so I'm good at making up stuff on the spot... also I'm not that fat!"" 
After that we did some light flirting I tried to get her number, and was shot down because she already has a boyfriend... Regardless it was a bit of an ego boost because I am verry insecure about my weight, and I think she knew that."

In the kitchen equipment aisle of the biggest supermarket in town and they didn't have a loaf tin! Only round ones, muffin trays or springforms. I huff because that means I have to walk to the other side of town to the other supermarket to try there.

Meanwhile, Middle Aged Lady (MAL) approaches me and starts yapping away, despite my bright orange headphones... I take them off and ask her to start over.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/czvpom/wearing_red_is_an_automatic_bullseye/,"Wearing red is an automatic bullseye. So, I’ve been reading a bunch of these and remembered an incident at a Tarjay near me not long after I moved here a few years ago.  I am on mobile, so please excuse any formatting faux pas.

A little context.  I work for a software company in the south.  We mostly deal with various energy companies and emergency services and do training for them, help them when they have an emergency, and basically try to make it so they don’t have to think about paperwork as much because the software takes care of a lot of it.  The biggest takeaway from this though is that our uniform is a red polo or button down with the company name, with slacks or jeans, and either boots or nice shoes, depending on if we are in an office or out in the field.

I also should state that before I started working here, I worked a lot of retail jobs, along with doing a 4 year military stint and going to college.  I’m now in my mid-30s.  Because of all the retail jobs though, I know how crappy they can be, so I have caught myself putting away things that fell off shelves and pegs, walking carts that are left in parking spaces all the way to corrals or back to the store, and help people lift things or get things from shelves since I’m tall.  I’m also heavy set.  But I digress...

The Story: About 5-6 months after I had moved from one state to another because I had landed this job (yay 1700 mile drive!), I was at a Tarjay looking for some random stuff after work (I remember I needed a new pillow and wanted to see if they had nicer sheets and a comforter, but I don’t remember everything I was looking for).  I do remember on my way in I had parked in a spot with a few carts left outside of corrals by lazy people, so I grabbed about 5 of them and pushed them into the store because they could have scratched MY car (seriously people, don’t just leave your cart out in a parking spot). 

I then took one and walked around the store, looking at the leftover Valentines candy, looking at some art supplies, etc, putting away some carelessly dropped items that belonged on pegs if I saw them.  As I passed by one aisle, a nice old lady was trying to grab something from an upper shelf and couldn’t quite reach, so I grabbed it and put it in her cart for her.  She thanked me and I said it was no problem and to have a nice day then continued on with my empty cart (yeah, literally had nothing so far).  I was nearing the bedding aisle when from behind I heard the dreaded sound.  I’m going to be paraphrasing (with maybe a little embellishment), but the exchange went something like this.

Karen: Hey you!

Me: *turning to see a woman of 50-ish, with a typical Karen haircut, only in brown with no highlights, wearing blue sweatpants and a darker blue sweatshirt* Yes?

K: I’ve been chasing you around the store for an hour!  I need you to help me now! (I don’t know how she got an hour, but I had only been there for 20-30 minutes)

Me: Huh?

K: I need your help!  Are you deaf and dumb?  *under her breath* God, Tarjay employees are f—-ing idiots.

Me: I don’t wo-

K: C’mon!  Hurry up.

At this point I’m just staring at her, trying to figure out how this is going to play out.  I’d dealt with Karens before, but I had worked for the business they were berating me at.

K: *after a second* Hey! Fatass!  Let’s go!  

Me: *louder, but not yelling* I don’t work here lady!

K: Then why are you wearing the f—-ing shirt?!

I then realized the confusion, so I chuckled.

Me: Oh, yeah.  I work for &lt;company name&gt;.  I guess our shirts are the same-

K: Whatever!  Hurry up and help me or I’ll get you fired!

Now I hate it when people cut me off, and that was twice she had done it.  At this point, all the years of retail and the people who were terrible customers started flowing through my head, and I was getting annoyed and quickly getting pissed. 

K: Let’s go, Fatass!

And that was the straw that broke the camels back.

Me: *fully yelling in my big booming voice (I’m going to omit the crazy amount of F-bombs I dropped because I used my Sailor tongue to it’s fullest)*  LISTEN HERE B——!!!  I! DON’T! F—-ING! WORK! HERE!  Just because I’m wearing a red shirt doesn’t mean I work here, and if you’d close your mouth and open your ears, you might actually have heard me say that twice already!  I’m betting you’re one of those b——es who complains that every store you go to has sh—-y customer service but I can tell you the reason you get sh—-y customer service is because you are a c—- and no one wants to be around you!  You look like the kind of sh** stain that hasn’t done a bit of work in her life other than opening her mouth and sucking some d—-, so how about you get a personality other than being a wino b—— and instead of demanding that everyone bow to your whim you say a simple please!!! 

Karen was speechless.  I ended my rant with a final F—- YOU and a middle finger as I left my cart where it was and walked out of the store.

I went home after that and went to Wallymart the next day and found some cheap black sheets and even cheaper build-a-furniture.  It wasn’t until October that I set foot in that Tarjay again, and luckily no one recognized me."

A little back story. My mother is a full blown Karen and I try my best to show her right but it seems to just be engrained in her nature. Like calls the manager, bitches about people in front of them and just all around clueless and ugh. 

We went on a trip to Vietnam a couple of years back and did a tour bus thing for a couple of days. We met everyone else we were travelling with at a restaurant in Hanoi. Everyone in the group was white except one man (K) who arrived with his Australian partner and MIL. They sat down with us and K was chatting away with us, told us he was originally from Taiwan, now lived in australia. 

However, after a while of small talk with everyone (the guide hadn't turned up yet) my mother, who seems to think all asians are the same, asks him where he is taking us on our trip. Everyone else around the table stared wide eyed as we all knew he was just another tourist. K goes ""haha sorry I'm on this trip just like you"". However my mother was in Karen mode and continues with ""well yes, but where is our first stop. And what activities will we be doing?"" 

I then tap her on the arm and say ""mum, he is just a tourist like us."" She goes ""oh"" and shuts up but K let's out a loud ""HA! Not all asians look the same, darling"". It put her in her place and I'm glad. They got on well the rest of the trip though."

She let out a kind of explosive ""Do I look like I work here!?"" and I tried to apologize several times but she was talking through them about how her husband worked there but she didn't. I was trying to make light of it but she was just angry, which I can get. But she was behind one of the counters at the spot where the cashier checks people out, so I figured she worked POS.

In her defense, she was wearing a Clemson University Football shirt, not something that would really look like a uniform. In my defense though, it would not be at all unusual for an employee in a relatively casual setting to be wearing one, as we live about a half hour from Clemson.

Fiance and I usually go our separate ways in the store to achieve the best efficiency of finishing our list as fast as possible, so I was alone when this interaction started.

An older Karen, probably around 60 was putting around the soup aisle and hemming and hawing at the sale (10 for $10) and I guess she saw me with my cart putting something back on the shelf. She cleared her throat a few times and stomped around but obviously I was just minding my own business.

K: HEY. LADY.

Me: \*deciding between strafesay brand mac and cheese or craft\*

K: HEY YOU! MANAGER! EXCUSE ME! HEY!

Me: \*finally acknowledging her\* Oh me? I'm not a manager. Did you need some help or something?

K: Well OBVIOUSLY you're a manager why else would you be dressed like that! Which of these soups count for the 10 for 10?!

Me: Um. I'm not a manager, I don't work here, and I don't know, probably the ones that are directly labeled in the sign that says 10 for 10??

K: WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM?

Me: You're the one yelling at me -

Karen stomped over wagging her finger at me like I was a child, yelling at me about customer service, how I should do my job and help her choose her soups, and all that's wrong with the ""youth today"". Something also along the lines of me getting fired for incompetence, I don't know, I zoned out.

Me: Ma'am if you need help please go up to one of the cashiers that work here and ask them, I'm here buying food like you.

K: STOP LYING! DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID! YOU'RE A F\*\*\*ING MANAGER HERE!  YOU'RE WEARING THE COSTUME YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST -

Me: Okay listen, I -

Then Karen smacks my hand - making me drop the box of mac and cheese I was holding.

K: DON'T F\*\*\*ING INTERRUPT ME!

Me: WHAT THE HELL LADY, YOU JUST HIT ME!

K: YEAH I DID! YOU INTERRUPTED ME!

Me: SERIOUSLY WHAT THE HELL!

At this point my fiance heard my yelling and zoomed over. He was also dressed nicely - button up, black slacks, the works.

F: What's happening, babe are you alright?

Me: She just slapped my hand because she's too thick to hear me when I say I DON'T WORK HERE!

F: What?

K: YOU NEED TO FIRE THIS B\*TCH SHE WON'T DO HER JOB!!

F: Do you really think everyone dressed remotely nice is a manager?

\*Crickets\*

K: Well I know she is! She was putting back that jar earlier!

Me: BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BUY IT YOU DUMBASS.

K: YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY!

Me: Babe grab an actual manager please I want to call the cops on this crazy b\*tch.

K: I'M A PAYING CUSTOMER!

Me & F: SO ARE WE!!!

&#x200B;

This is getting long, so the rest of it went like this:

She stepped back in shock that we both yelled at her and Fiance waved over some poor unsuspecting person. The ACTUAL manager got there and the lady started her BS again about how both me and my fiance should get fired, how we suck, etc etc blah. She proudly admitted to hitting me btw (which was hilarious) The manager looked at us and back at her and told her to apologize for hitting me and that she should leave. She AGAIN mentioned my ""Manager costume"" and how it's my fault. The manager, in his ACTUAL manager outfit pointed at his badge and name tag, his specific all black outfit and tried to explain to her that all managers are dressed like he was, that we were definitely not managers just because we looked nice, and she's assaulting another customer.

K: BUT SHE DESERVED IT FOR TALKING BACK TO ME!

The manager had this ""I want to run you over with a car look"" on his face and he slowly spoke to her like she was 3, again explaining that we didn't work there. I piped up, asking the manager politely to inform the woman that if she didn't apologize I would like him to call the police and file for assault. The manager repeated this to the lady S-L-O-W-L-Y and the lady screeched and threw a can on the ground, swiped her arm through a bunch of the soups causing them to avalanche to the ground and briskly waddled out of the store.

We helped the manager pick up the soups, even though he kept saying sorry and that we didn't have to help him, and he asked if I really wanted to press charges. I said no, there's no point I just thought it would make her go away, but if he wanted to make a police report I would be happy to provide my statement. We laughed about my ""manager costume"" and got a $30 gift card to use for our groceries.

TL;DR: Don't wear fancy clothes at the grocery store for you may encounter the single digit IQ creature that is Karen.

I had just had a very stressful 11 hour shift, full of entitled customers yelling at me over things that were in no way my control (we were a computer retailer, and a Windows update had come out the previous day that killed the WiFi in many people’s computers).  After work, I went across the street to the grocery store to pick up a few things before heading home to go to sleep.  At this grocery store, all employees wear black dress slacks, a white button down shirt, and a black tie.   That happened to be the same colors I was wearing.



I probably didn’t handle this the way I should have, but I was so done getting treated like shit for the day...



Me:  *looking at boxes of granola bars trying to decide what to get*

Crazy Lady (CL):  “Are you going to help me or are you just going to stand there.  I had you paged 30 minutes ago!”

Me:  I don’t say anything to her.  I just stare at her thinking to myself that I can’t even buy granola without dealing with customers.

CL: “Helooooooo!!!  I have my list ri....”

Me: “I don’t care.”

CL: “Excuse me?! Tha...”

Me: “I don’t care.”

CL: “Where is your mana...”

Me: “I don’t care.”

CL: Red in the face and at this point yelling, “You’re going to get fir...”

Me: “I don’t care”

CL: “Wha..”

Me: “I don’t care.”

At this point a manager comes by and ask what the problem is.  She screeches at him about me.  He explains that I don’t work there.   And she says to the manager...

CL: “I don’t care!  Just help me!”


I guess I taught her a new phrase."

I put my 3 old my shoulders because it was pitch black; the emergency lights didn’t come on. After 10 minutes the power didn’t come on so we forced our way out of the closed automatic doors and a guy in the crowd of people standing outside asked me “when y’all open” (it was like 3pm). I looked around thinking an employee came out but it was just me. I told him the power was out and you should ask that lady (an employee kind of standing in the entrance of the grocery store making sure people didn’t leave with carts full of food). As I was walking away he asked again “y’all opening soon?”. I just kept on walking.
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/czgrv3/ripndip_pop_up/,"RIPNDIP pop up At the beginning of this year I was in LA for the weekend and saw that RIPNDIP (a skateboard clothing brand) was having a pop up clearance store for a few days. I’m 18 and with my parents so I convince them to let me get some cheap clothes for me and a friend. 

I only had 2 shirts from this clothing company at the time but didn’t wear them on this particular day. I sorta fit into the ‘look’ of the brand I guess??? 

So my mom waits in the massive line while I look around frantically with a million people around me and I got through the racks of clothes in the middle probably 3 times to find something good. The clothes on racks were lots of old shirts and jackets they don’t sell anymore so I was just killing time and trying to find one my buddy would like. 

Then a 50-55 year old woman comes up to me and asks a question and I’m sitting there like “uhhhh what?”....... Then it clicked: OOHHH, “No, I don’t know, I don’t work here.” That’s when I knew I spent too much time looking and should probably just get in line. 

I’m a pretty clean cut guy and was dressed nicer than the majority of people there so maybe she saw me as approachable?? Whatever it was I laughed and felt a bit uncomfortable afterwards.

At the time, I worked for a company that issued blue and white badges to employees and I went to Walmart after work. I wasn't thinking about it but my badge was still out in the open.

As I was walking through the sporting goods section, an older gentleman caught my attention and asked me if I could open the case to get some ammo for him. I responded ""Sorry, I don't work here.""

The conversation went like this.

Him: ""But, can you find someone to help me.""

Me: ""If I see someone who does work here, I can let them know that you need help.""

Him: ""I want you to find someone to help me.""

Me: ""I don't work here.""

Him: ""But I need someone to help me!""

Me: ""I DON'T WORK AT WALMART! I'M SHOPPING, JUST LIKE YOU!""

At that point, he looked at my badge and realized that the company listed wasn't Walmart.

He explained that he saw the blue & white badge and thought that I worked at Walmart but maybe in a different department. He apologized. We shook hands and went about finishing our days. I tucked my badge into my shirt."

I found a great spot out front and had  to run back up to my apartment and grab something and got back down to my car. I was sitting in my car getting my phone ready with music before I left. While doing that my two back doors open up and two kids climb in. They don’t speak great English and are trying to tell me where to go. I turned around and told them that I’m not an Uber driver. So they sat in the back of my car on their phones trying to figure out what was going on with their Uber. I had to scream “GET OUT OF MY CAR”.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cz1fbv/work_here_i_dont_even_shop_here/,"Work here? I don't even shop here. I'm a truck driver. I got a load delivering to a Costco store (which was weird because I usually only deliver to their distribution centers - thank fuck for Google Street View).  Anyway, I arrived, parked my rig, and went to go check in.  A random employee let me in through the receiving door and told me to wait right there while he went to go get the manager to sign for the delivery.

I don't know how it is at other stores, but for the location I was at, after going through the exterior door that said receiving above it, there was a desk-counter thing immediately to my right. The inside of the receiving docks was immediately to my left. There was a large open area where the pallets are temporarily stored as they're pulled off the truck, before being sorted for wherever they're being taken. There was a walk space of about four or five feet behind the desk counter, and then a wall - I'm pretty sure it hid the staff break room.  I could see around the walled-off area into the Costco's back storage area. Between the storage area and the open area for the docks,  there was an open space that led into the store proper. It had a bright yellow chain draped across it, and the plastic rectangle in the middle presumably said something like 'employees only' or 'authorized personnel only'.

After about ten minutes of of bored staring about, I pulled out my phone and started playing Scrabble.  I'd just managed to land 'faqir' on triple word score when I heard that irritated tsking noise I usually only hear from non-smokers when I'm choosing to poison myself in a public area.

I glanced up and looked around, but didn't see anybody in the immediate vicinity. I went back to my game. Half a heartbeat later, I hear, ""EXCUSE ME!""

I glanced up again, idly wondering if maybe the manager had finally come back to sign for the damn delivery. No joy. Since there were no employees looking like they were ready to sign my stack of paperwork and tell me what dock they want it backed into, I went back to my game.

Again came a louder, ""EXCUSE ME!""

I finally triangulated the sound and saw a wild Karen standing just past the chain separating the store from the dock.  Unfortunately, she noticed me see her.

""You know you really shouldn't be on your phone,"" she smarmed at me like some sort of patronizing kindergarten teacher.  ""There's customers out here who need your help.""

I looked down at my t-shirt, then up at her, then just shook my head. My t-shirt was black with screen printing of a Peterbilt, and read, 'My parents told me I could be anything, so I became a trucker and an asshole!'

""Not my problem,"" I replied.

""I just need you to check back there for [random whozit I've never heard of].  Now put your phone away, and help me!""

I rolled my eyes.  ""I don't work here. Fuck, I don't even shop here.  I do all my bulk at Sam's.""

She turned fluorescent red, and for a moment I thought it was because of embarrassment. Nope.

""HOW DARE YOU CUSS AT A CUSTOMER!  GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!""

My inner demon, never really on a leash to begin with, grinned maniacally and took control. I gave the bitch my biggest shit eating grin. I spun around.  ""Hi, you numbcunted fuckwitted asshat!  I'm [OP's] boss!  I understand you have a problem, but I can't possibly give a shit!  I drove 600 miles to deliver a 53-foot trailer full of all the crap you buy here, only to get cut off and honked at multiple times in the parking lot  while navigating to the store's shittastic dock.  My patience has been exhausted for the day, and your idiocy is not making my life any easier.""

I wasn't yelling at her, I was talking loud enough she could hear me.  I was still standing next to the desk-counter thing. She had taken several steps towards me, straining the plastic chain.  Her eyes were bugged out, and her face was freaking purple.

""HOW DARE YOU!  I'M A PAYING CUSTOMER...""  I quit listening and just let screech.

I'm sure she was about to launch into a tirade for the ages, but I really did not want to hear it. I took a couple of steps away from the counter and poked my head through the doorway of the walled-off area. My earlier assumption was correct - it was the break room, complete with some poor girl eating her lunch.

""Hey,"" I said, "" I know you're on your break, but could you get the store manager back here? I've been waiting quite a while for him to come sign for the delivery I've got for y'all, and there's a screaming harpy yelling.""

""I already called him,"" the girl said, holding up her phone. ""He's on his way.""

""Thankee kindly,"" I replied, and returned to my post.

The woman was still screeching at me. I tuned out and ignored her, focusing instead on how to use a goddamn W and three fucking Fs in one word. 

About a minute, maybe a minute and a half later, the manager finally arrived. The woman immediately started in on demanding I be fired, and how can he let his employees be so disrespectful, blah, blah, blah.

I got to give props to that dude, he managed to listen to her respectfully, and deescalate her down to just seething, instead of apoplectic. When she finally managed to run out of steam, he told her that I didn't work there.

Moreover, he was able to determine that whatever it was the cunt was looking for, they were actually out, and she would have to wait for more to come in.

Cue the wild Karen slinking dejectedly back into the store.  Awesome manager dude then let me know to back into dock two while scanning the barcode on my paperwork.  He signed my copy and handed it back to me, laughing a little.

He accompanied me outside to cut the seal on my trailer and explained what was so funny. Apparently, whatever it was the bitch had been looking for, was included in my trailer. However, he'd had multiple problems with that customer in the past, so he was definitely not going to let her know.

A happy ending to the story: awesome manager dude let me park overnight at the dock, since I was running low on hours, and it was already 17:00 (the city I delivered to tends to run out of truck parking between 15:00 and 16:00)."

Okay so first some background. I live in mid sized town with an upper class part nearby so its kinda common to see some people with that ""rich"" aura and attire. Also I'm 16 and law states you can't work until you are 18 or older. I also look a few years older than I should a steady bit a facial hair and quite tall about 6'7.

Anyway story time.

 About a month ago my mom told me go to the grocery store near our house to get some stuff she forgot to buy for dinner. Its short walk about 4 blocks away so I agreed and she gave some to buy it with. 
 I go down there, walk through the doors and I see a lady with a big black puffy fur coat designer pants and shoes and LOTS of jewelry I walk past her and make my way to the dairy section.
 while I'm searching for some cheddar blocks I hear a ""ahem"" behind me. I ignored it thinking it wasn't for me and continue on my way a few minutes later I hear a somewhat sassy ""Hey. You."" along with a pat on my shoulder. 
 I turned around and low and behold it was the same exact lady. Me being polite said ""yeah?"".
 She goes in an annoyed tone ""Jesus fucking Christ finally I've been trying to get your attention for like 20 minutes. ( I was on like 5 by the way) can you please for the love of god fire this stupid guy?
 I get what is going on fairly quickly and calmly say "" sorry ma'am I don't work here."" She starts yelling "" BULLSHIT I KNOW YOU WORK HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE WEAR THE OUTFIT AND I KNOW YOUR COVERING FOR THAT STUPID ASSHOLE!!! "" 
 Now I can sorta see why she thought I worked there. The outfits employees wear it a red T-shirt with a logo on it, pants and closed toe shoes. I was wearing a red long sleeve shirt jeans and boots.
 Now I'm usually a nice but when I get annoyed people instantly realize. (a friend of mine once said I give off an intimidating aura when o get angry) I also have a major anger issue and one of the main triggers is yelling. So I instantly got pissed.
 The lady realized this and smacked me twice in a row. Then started yelling "" DONT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT YOU PIECE OF SHIT"" 

 At this point I completely lost my shit and grabbed her hand when she tried to smack me again and shoved her away. She fell on ass before I started yelling "" I ALREADY TOLD YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT! I DON'T FUCKING WORK HERE! MAYBE IF CLEANED THE GUNK OUT YOUR EAR AND LISTENED YOU COULD BE GETTING HELP FROM SOMEONE ACTUALLY DOES!!! "" 
 She just sits there dumfounded for a few seconds while a manager rushes over and asks what happened. 
Skipping forward no cops were called and she went home and I got a gist card plus free cheese blocks. 
 When I got home my mom asked me what took so long. I told her the whole story and the only thing she had to say after laughing was "" well that's what she gets for slapping my son.""."

Like excuse me you want me to go back to your storage area to find a pair of shoes for this random lady when its your job...

Apologies for any formatting as I'm posting on mobile.

I was spending time at GameStop because I was seeing one of the workers there at the time and would come in to spend some time with her between customers, and also because I became good friends with the other works there.

I noticed an older woman with her kid(8ish) walking back and forth between the Switch setup and the PS4 setup with a notebook in her hands, and looking at one wall of games and accessories and walking back to look at the other. I noticed that Jess and Amy (names changed) were busy with a crowd of people, and since I like helping people anyway, I decided to walk over and ask her I'd she needed any help.

She said that she didn't really know anything about gaming, but she was trying to figure out what she should get her son and couldnt decide what console to get. I ended up spending about an hour explaining the differences between the consoles, their strengths and weaknesses, what kind of experience to expect for her and her son, etc. She ended up going with my recommendation for getting a switch, when the fated question was asked.

Lady: So when is the next sale on the switch stuff so I can try and get a better deal?

Me:  I'm sorry Ma'am, I dont know when the next sale is, but if you ask Jess or Amy they might know since they work here.

Lady: You dont work here?

Me: Nope.

Lady: Thank you so much for your help, but why did you spend an hour of your time talking to me about all this?

Me: I like helping people and you looked like you might have needed some.

Turns out GS employees don't know when the sales are because corporate doesnt tell them until about 3 days prior.

Lady said she would come back later to get the switch but I stopped seeing that girl and coming in as often, so I never found out if she did.

TL:DR Older lady is walking around GameStop looking like she needs help, I spend an hour explaining everything to her despite not working there."

This occurred a few years ago during the christmas shopping season. My sister and I went to the grocery store to buy some ingredients so that we could make a pre christmas dinner for our parents and grandparents. We were both wearing red shirts in honor of the christmas season.

I was picking out the vegetables when I noticed my sister was gone, I backtracked to another aisle we were in and spotted her struggling to get what looked to be a christmas decoration (i think it was those angels you put at the top of the christmas tree) from the top shelf. Next to her was this old lady in a an electric shopping cart along with a young little girl (i assumed it was grandmother and granddaughter).

I went up to my sister and she asked me to help get the object. My sister is considerably short (about 4'10"", I'm about 5'4"") and not as well built as me so getting the object was impossible for her. I got the object with relative ease (and was kinda surprised by the bulk and weight of it) and placed it in the old lady's cart after asking her where she would like me to put it.

The old lady looked up to the both of us with this sweet smile and ask us to direct her to the manager so that she could tell them how wonderful employees they have. My sister and I both looked at each other and realized the lady thought we were employees due to the store being known for their employees that wear red shirts. We told her that we were customers just like her and she had a brief moment of confusion then shock before apologizing to which we said it was fine.

She then smiled again and turned towards the little girl and said:

""See this? These girls are real angels."" 

The little girl looked at us with this expression of joy and wonder.

We wished each other Merry Christmas and went on our merry way. Pre christmas dinner that day was delicious."

An elderly ""Karen"" in a fur coat flagged me down and I came over to chat because it's a small, friendly midwestern US town. Fur coat Karen skipped the usual pleasantries and told me her table needed cleaning. I was a bit slow on the uptake and just looked stunned. Fur coat Karen repeated her request slowly and clearly. I was still confused and I replied ""Why are you asking me?""

Fur coat Karen was seated with her husband. He heard my question and looked at me. I have long hair, brown skin, jeans & hoodie, plus three kids who look just like me. Fur coat Karen's husband figured it out immediately and was clearly embarrassed. He said quietly, ""I don't think she works here."" Fur coat Karen looked around, spotted an actual employee in uniform, holding a mop. Her explanation: ""Oh, I thought you were THAT one.""

She excused her mistake by pointing to the only other brown person in the room. The actual employee was at least 20 years older than me, short-haired, wearing a uniform, and obviously engaged in work.

So for the last couple years I’ve been flying weekly to the Seattle area for work.  Back home to Houston for the weekends.  It makes following up with Doctors a challenge.   I also had surgery on my rear end  a year ago that had complications of pain and infections.  So I ended up having two additional surgeries for a persistent reoccurring abscess down there. 

After the last surgery (emergently in Seattle)  I had a follow up appointment with the surgeon.   The surgery consisted of draining the abscess.  Leaving the drain in for two weeks.  And wearing Depends to work and hoping nothing leaked..  (maybe this is TMI, but it’s important to the story)

So I go to my follow up to get the drains removed and have her evaluate the progress.  

I go to the doctors office midday directly from work.  For work I wear a nice shirt, a tie, slacks, and dress shoes.  I also carry a decent sized leather bag for all my class stuff when I teach.  I probably look like a pharmaceutical rep.  Which is important in a minute.  

The waiting room is half full. Lots of middle aged and elderly people quietly waiting their turn. So I go and sign in and take a seat.  (Gingerly.. cuz it’s a little sensitive down below) 

While waiting I see an elderly lady pacing and obviously annoyed.  It becomes clear that “Ethel” here thinks the wait is too long.  Every time someone gets called back she gets a little more visibly annoyed.  Now usually I’d call her a Karen, but she’s disheveled and something seems off about her.  As a nurse, I’ve seen plenty of dementia patients and she reminds me of them.  

Every couple of patients called back before her causes her to approach the front desk and shriek at the receptionist about having to wait so long.  The Saint of a receptionist keeps her cool and explains her appointment is at noon and it’s barely 11.  

My appointment is at 11:30 and when I hear my name called I gather my bag to go in and Ethel loses her shit.   She screeches at the front office about how she has to wait while the Doctor sees Salespeople?!?!

I should have just walked by, but I tried to rescue the receptionist from more abuse.  I say. I don’t work here, I’m a patient and My appointment is at 11:30.   But Ethel is having none of it.  She obviously doesn’t believe me and continues railing at the front desk while the lady calling me back looks on wide eyed. 

I give up trying to help and step past the mess into the hallway where the nurse escorts me into Exam room 1.  All while Ethel looks on in fury.   

The nurse takes my vitals and history.  Asks how everything is going and directs me to undress and put on the gown she provides. 

I comply with directions and wait for the Doc.  When she comes in we discuss my history, my surgery, and how things have been going.  Then we get down to business. 

I lay back.  Hike my legs up so she has access to the necessary areas and cup my balls to get them out of the way.  

She gets to work removing the stitches and removing my drains..  asking about drainage and discharge..   when Boom!!!

The door flies open and we hear yelling.  I already know.   

In the doorway stands Ethel. And the only thing between me, her, and the waiting room is the head of my 5’2 Asian surgeon.  And then not even that because the Doc whips around in shock and Ethel gets a full view of my goat balled nether region with rubber tubes and drainage.  With me lifting my head to look through my legs I make eye contact with Ethel.   Who is standing mouth agape and blessedly silent for once.

I had the great pleasure of saying, “I TOLD you I don’t work here.”"

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cyrnay/i_dont_work_here_yet/,"""I don't work here... yet"" I already posted a story here but I had one more I wanted to share. This happened a little over a year ago. I went for a job interview in Penneys and wore a suit (not my idea, it was my first job interview and my mam insisted that I had to wear a suit, I was later told in the interview that I was one of the only people to go for a job interview there in a full suit lol). I arrived at the store about half an hour before my interview so I found a remote area of the store to go over interview questions while I waited. I must've looked like management or security or something (which is surprising because I was 18 at the time but had a baby face so I looked closer to 16) because while I waited I was approached multiple times by people asking where something was. I would just smile and say ""I don't work here... yet"" and then explain I'm here for a job interview. Most people just went red, apologized and walked away but a couple wished me luck in my interview. I was able to use the story to break the ice in the interview which made the manager laugh. In the end, I got the job.

TLDR: I got mistaken for an employee multiple times when I went for a job interview."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cyl7e6/wheres_the_frozen_stuff/,"""Where's the frozen stuff?"" This probably isn't that exciting of a story but I've been binge-reading this subreddit and wanted to share my experience. This happened about a year ago, I and a co-worker went to get lunch in a shop down the road from the Penneys (Primark for those of you that aren't from Ireland) we worked at. The uniforms in this shop were bright red with a nametag pinned to it, the uniform I was wearing was bright blue with a Penneys logo on it and a lanyard so the uniforms couldn't look more different. I have never been to this shop before and was at the front of the store looking at the drinks when a middle-aged woman appeared beside me. I'm going to call her Karen because I don't know her real name and Karen just fits. 

Karen: ""Ahem, where's the frozen stuff in here? Is it at the back?"" 

Me: ""I don't know.""

Karen: ""What?""

Me: ""I don't know""

Karen: ""What do you mean you don't know?""

Me: ""What I mean is I don't know where the frozen stuff is.""

I was getting frustrated at this point, I had been working for hours and was tired and hangry and just wanted this woman to go away but I tried to be nice.

Karen: ""How the hell could you not know where it is?""

Me: ""Well for starters I've never been here before.""

She gets a confused look on her face and looks me up and down and then gets a look of surprise.

Karen: ""Oh, you don't work here do you?""

Me: ""No""

I smile realizing it was just a misunderstanding and expecting us both to just laugh it off but then she scowls at me and puts on a tone.

Karen: SIGH ""Why didn't you just tell me you didn't work here and I would've left you alone sooner.

Translation: ""Why didn't you tell me you didn't work here instead of wasting both our time.""

Her sudden attitude took me by surprise and before I could say anything she stormed off. In case anyone is wondering, I didn't tell her I didn't work there sooner it was because I didn't realize she thought I was an employee until right before she said it, admittedly I probably should've picked it up sooner but as I said at the time I was tired, hungry and distracted."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cyo7me/a_wholesome_idwhl_from_an_irish_folk_park/,"A wholesome IDWHL from an Irish folk park Not my story, from my father-in-law (FIL). 

Background info: Ireland in the 40s, 50s and 60s was a very poor place. Especially in the countryside. For example, my mother was one of 11 children. She grew up in a small house with 3 rooms. In that house you entered into the main room that was the main living area and there was a bedroom off 2 ends of that room. Totally size of the house was maybe 3x10 metres (10x30 feet).  Both of my parents and both of my wife’s parents grew up in similar situations during those decades. 

There’s lots of old castles around Ireland. In the 80s and 90s they started being be fixed up as tourist attractions. Some of them would build up a folk park around the castle. These would be a collection of different types of stone cottages, and houses from different parks of the country, built in different styles, different stone, that kind of thing. 

The story: my wife, her sisters and her parents visit one of these folk parks around 25/30 years ago. As they’re walking around my FIL is explaining various bits and pieces in the different buildings. The device used to hang pots over the fire to cook food, how the thatch was put on the roofs, the probable socioeconomic status of the family from one house compared to the “wealthy farming house” in a different area of the park, that kind of thing. 

It didn’t take long for him to have a gathering of tourists listening to his every word and asking loads of questions. He was delighted with himself being able to tell the (mainly) American tourists about the homes their grandparents probably lived in before they emigrated. 

Many of them mistook him for a guide in the park and were a bit embarrassed afterwards when they found out that he was just visiting with his family, but he insisted it was no problem and was happy to answer any questions they had."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cyhjhe/one_of_my_few_nice_stories_from_my_retail_days/,"One of my few nice stories from my retail days So not sure if this belongs here but it is honestly one of my favourite stories to tell.
A few years back I worked in a large retail chain I wont name it for obvious reasons but the main thing you need to know is I am a young female and I wore a standard all black uniform (pants and a jumper).

Our story takes place during my lunch break where I was wearing the all black uniform, on my break in another shop. I was browsing in a clothes shop getting ready to head back to work as I did pretty regularly when I hear just about the cutest voice speak up to me 'Hi excuse me, Hi' I look down trying not to laugh because it was such an adorable voice and then I see two cute little girls look back at me *both under the age of 7 if I had to guess.

 So I say 'hi are you ok?' And the older girl replies 'no we're lost!' So me being 19 at the time and never dealing with something like this before think oh god what do I do then I realise they think I work here (which is weird because the staff in this shop dont wear a uniform but a 5 year old didn't notice i guess) so I realise they want me to call their mom over the intercom. I ask who they came with and they say their cousin, the younger girl then says some things but all I can remember now is she stated her cousin was 'not an adult, shes only a teenager!' Which made me feel even worse for the poor cousin who is probably frantic looking for these two little cuties. I then quickly try to explain to them that they did the right thing by coming up to me and not leaving the shop and that it would be ok, not to worry etc etc. I tell them I dont work there and their little faces are blank but I tell them I'll stay with them until we find someone to help.

Then I am rushing to find someone who actually worked there and wasnt now 5 minutes late to go back to work. Once I did I explained what happened and the staff member was freaked out but said she would look after it. Unfortunately I had to leave pretty quickly but I said my goodbyes to the girls and left them with staff. I came back later in the day and was told they were ok that their cousin was found within a few minutes and everyone and everything was fine.

Not exactly a dramatic story but is a quote I still use with friends to this day 'hi excuse me hi'"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cyafpg/why_does_everybody_at_the_adidas_outlet_think_i/,"Why does everybody at the Adidas outlet think I work at the Adidas outlet? This might be one of the less exciting IDWHL stories,  but it definitely qualifies. My apologies if it’s kind of long. TLDR at the bottom.

For work, in the Spring and Summer time, I wear a polo and whatever pants I feel like, typically chinos or cotton, five pocket trousers that resemble jeans. I wear sneakers, and I like to wear Adidas because they’re what I find to be comfortable, but only toned down shoes that look less sporty since they’re for work. 

Two or three days a week, I travel from Pittsburgh to Morgantown or Wheeling, West Virginia, about an hour trip, one way. Along the way, there is an outlet mall, and I’ll stop by for twenty minutes or a half-hour just to see what they have on sale, and, apparently, everybody shopping at the Adidas store thinks I work there. Everybody. 

In their defense, I wear headphones while I stop into the stores, and I do wear Adidas shoes, but I look nothing like the people working there, and the shoes I wear for work do not have a visible logo or three stripes on them.

For comparison, imagine a guy with grey headphones in both ears, a pastel or vibrant red or blue polo with a Brooks Brother’s Golden Fleece on it (feel free to Google that), khakis, and plain, Navy blue, canvas shoes.

Now imagine four people in black and white wearing Adidas lanyards with name badges, a black, two way radio on their hip with an single earpiece, Adidas t shirts (and only Adidas t shirts, never a golf polo, never anything with a collar), sometimes track jackets and typically black jeans or track pants. All of these articles of clothing have giant trefoils or three stripes on them and the word “Adidas” plastered all over them. They look a lot like my middle school and high school gym coaches but only ever in black, white, and grey. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say nearly every time I go there a suburban mom, dad, or teen asks me if I have a certain size in something. They walk up to me staring down at a box of shoes they are holding and go “um, can you see if you have this...” and I always cut them off with a stern, robotic “I-don’t-work-here.” It’s bizarre. It only happens at the Adidas store, and it always happens at the Adidas store. If there are other customers shopping, they will ask me for something.

The craziest time this happened was around the Fourth of July sale they had, which lasted all week long. I stopped in on Monday or Tuesday coming back to Pittsburgh, it was only going to be a three day work week for me because of the holiday, so I figured I’d kill a minute and see if they had anything good. It was really busy. I walked in to look at the styles and was immediately approached by a mom asking for something. I interrupted and said “I don’t work here.” She walked away. I go to the shoes and within minutes another mom starts asking me for a size and I tell her “I don’t work here.” I have a few moments of peace browsing, and a teenager comes up to me and starts stammering through his request for a different size in the shoes he was holding. I tell him I don’t work here, he says sorry, and walks away.

I’m about to leave when I tell one of the employees about my dilemma at his store, and that it just happened three times. He agrees that that is strange, but he doesn’t seem too invested in the conversation because, obviously, why would he care? We chat about a certain style I liked, and he offers to check in the back for me before I go. As soon as he steps away from me, from about a quarter of the way across the store, a woman scanning the room locks eyes with me, and with a single finger, in a Hulk Hogan like fashion, points directly at me enthusiastically, and begins to shout “I need...”  and I shout “no, I don’t work here.” I didn’t even have headphones in this time. She just looked away and continued to scan. The employee, who completely missed that interaction, returned to tell me he didn’t have the shoes, and I tell him “it totally just happened again. I gotta get outta here. Thanks for checking.”

And the end of this story is that this still continues to happen about once every two weeks. Every time I stop at the outlets on my way home, every time I go to the Adidas store, somebody thinks I work there despite not having any of the markings of an employee. People there look trendy and leisurely, and I am dressed like I’m going to set up your printer at your cubicle. I will sometimes stop at the Brooks Brother’s outlet in Brooks Brother’s clothes, with the Brooks Brother’s logo on my chest, and people there will not confuse me for an employee. 

TLDR: I am repeatedly confused for an employee of the Adidas outlet store despite not wearing anything resembling what the actual employees wear.

Edit: Replying to the several folks who have said people might think I’m a manager...

I mean, sure, in the sense that anybody anywhere might be a manager because they are wearing khakis and a polo, but this is a store that explicitly does not have anybody who wears khakis and a polo while several other stores at the mall has shoppers who don’t get confused when they see me. The confusing part is how often this happens. I mean, clearly I look like a person who works there, despite not looking at all like the people who work there."

I was looking around and 'trying' a few chairs when a woman came up to me and told me that I shouldn't be using the chairs. I normally don't like confrontations so I just apologized and began to walk off. She shouted after me and said how rude it was for me to walk away from her. I was very confused by this point so I just stand there. She then told me to go and find out if there were any deals on a table that's nearby. I said no, why should I and she looks appalled  and says for me to go and get my manager. I hadn't realized until this point that she thought that I worked here. I calmly explain to her that I didn't work there and she immediately looks apologetic. She says sorry for bothering me, she thought that because I was using a trolley I worked there?!?! I say it's fine and walk away even though I'm still a little bit annoyed. 

I go to meet up with my family and explain to them what had happened but I don't see the woman again.

A little background. 
A month ago i moved in a new  Apartment, that is rent my the church.
Because of this everyone assumes, that i work for them. At nearly the same time as I moved in, a new pastoral speaker had started his job at our parish community. So I often get confused with him.
I am an optician as you can tell by my name. ;)
Most the time, if someone mistakes my for a pastoral speaker, I just say, ""sorry I don't work here, I just live here."", and they apologized .

The house I live in contains my apartment and the parish office.  It has a small yard in the front and a bigger one in the back. We have a guy who take care of the front yard. Some times he tries to have a look after the backyard too, but mainly he doesn't have the time for it.

I love work with plants and plants. (My father is a gardener and I learned a lot of him)
So I started to clean up the backyard. But I didn't want to destroy anything that the other guy placed there on purpose. 

To the story. 
This week I finally managed to speak to him.
Every Tuesday I have my day off. 
I had my windows open, so I heard some was down into the backyard . I had  look and recognized it was the gardener. So I went down and we had a talk. It went really well. I told him was I am planning to do in there and apparently I can do down there what ever I want. (Yeah)
After a while he told me, that he had business else where and had to finish his work here. So we went inside. I went into my apartment and he through the door next to it.
I just went through my door, as he called me back and asked where I'm going and that he really had no time and really needed help.
He told me, that the lady at the front desk  had told him, that I would help him. 
I was a bit confused by this. Why would she tell that without asking me first? 
But I was free and glad I could help. 
He showed me some furniture that had to be brought down. I helped him. 
As we brought the first piece down the new pastoral speaker saw us and told me, that he would be with us in a minute. 
That's when I realized, that the gardener had me mistaken for the new pastoral speaker. 
But there where only two more pieces of furniture, so I finished it. 
After everything was brought down I told the gardener, that I will tell the pastoral speaker, that we are already finished the work, so the gardener could get to his next appointment. 
That was, when he realized his mistake. He apologized and we had a laugh about it. 

Sorry, that it turned out so long and that her there wasn't a real twist. 

Have a nice Sunday"

In the Southern USA there is a store chain called Publix. They are a very nice grocery store with a whole green theme going on. Employees wear dark green polos with name tags, and some wear aprons but not all. They pride themselves on their customer service.

One day I needed something from Publix. On that fateful day I happened to be wearing... a dark green polo. It was subtly branded with the name of the university I used to work at.

While I was browsing the nice deals end cap, a random lady appeared! And she asked me where $THING was! Well, I knew what to do. I started drawing breath, turned towards her, had the title of this Reddit on my lips, when... 

&#x200B;

""Oh, sorry, you don't work here. I saw the shirt and thought you worked here. Oh, hey, $UNIVERSITY\_SPORTSBALL\_TEAM! Yay $SPORTSBALL\_TEAM!"" and then she scuttled off with her body language saying how vaguely embarrassed she was by accosting a fellow shopper.

Well, folks, I was left standing there finger raised, mouth open, and looking like a fish that had just been Tased. I was totally thwarted from saying the famous phrase. I skulked off and finished my shopping, with all my Jimmies still rustling.  Nobody was hurt, no property was broken, and no-one was arrested. It was just a mildly amusing encounter on a random day.

At my job, we’re required to wear a polo with the  place’s logo and name, but they’re very prominent. Yesterday after work, I stopped to get gas at a station where their shirts happen to be the same color blue, but are t-shirts and the station’s name are emblazoned across the entire front of the shirt and they all have name tags and headsets as it’s a gas station/quick food service combo type of thing. I decided to get a drink after I filled my tank, but while I was checking out, I was mistaken for one of the gas station employees.

Me- Me
ABW- Angry bathroom woman
GSE- Gas Station Employee

I’m standing at the register buying my soda when ABW storms up and turns right to me.

ABW- “Why is the restroom locked? I knocked and no one is in there.”

I don’t answer because I assume she’s speaking to the employee behind the counter and continue getting money out of my wallet.

ABW- clears her throat and raises her voice. “MISS. WHY is the bathroom locked?”

This is when I look up and realize she’s completely ignoring the attendant behind the counter and is facing me.

Me- “Uh, gas stations often lock their bathroom just to be safe.”

ABW- “Well give me the key.”

Me (coming to the wrong conclusion)- “Oh, I didn’t use the restroom so I’m sorry but I don’t have the key.”

ABW- sighs angrily. “Well then go get the key so I can use the fucking bathroom!”

Me (it finally clicks)- “Oh! I’m so sorry but I don’t work here.” I point to the attendant literally 4 feet away behind the register. “I’m sure she’d be happy to help you though.”

ABW- “That’s ridiculous. You’re her manager. Just go get the fucking key. Is this how you treat all your customers?”

GSE- finally chimes in and says “M’am she doesn’t work here. I have the key right here,” and hands ABW the key.

ABW huffs “Well was that so difficult?” and storms off to the bathroom.

The employee and I both laughed once she’d stormed off and chatted for a minute. We figured since our shirts were the same blue that she must have just assumed mine was the fancier version and that made me the manager. The best part was that the employee she had ignored actually was the manager. So there you have it! Not anything too dramatic but it amused me."

This happened to me almost a year ago. My friends and I were going to our favorite Chinese noodle place near our university campus. The place was well known for selling a bowl of noodles for a decent price and they don't skimp on the noodles (my favorite is the Chong Qing Small Noodles). I often talk to the manager and because she doesn't speak english our conversations are in mandarin.

After a quick talk with the manager, my friends and I were waiting near the entrance for a table to open up when suddenly this little old lady holding a toddler came up to me and said ""四位"" (4 seats, normal way of telling restaurant workers  how many is in your party). I realized she mistook me for an employee and quickly told her that I don't work here. She gave me this mortified look and profusely apologized. I told her it was fine and directed her to an employee and shortly after my friends and I's table was ready. In the middle of our dinner I saw a young couple come up and join the old lady in waiting for their table (I assumed that the couple was the toddler's parents after seeing the toddler being passed onto the woman).  


A while later I ran into the old woman while walking through a grove area of campus ( the young couple and their toddler were nearby having a picnic). She apologized again for the mix up which again I told her is fine. Turn out she was visiting her son (who is a professor at my school) and wanted to meet her grandson. This reminded ne alot of how my maternal grandmother came all the way from China to help take care of me as an infant. She also complimented my mandarin stating I sounded like a Old Beijing native (to which i explained my parents were both from Beijing hence the accent). We said good by and I continued my walk feeling a bit more happy."

Since it's been so hot this summer I made it a habit to stop by the McDonalds near my workplace and grab some ice cream every day. 
Last week I walked in and ordered the same as always, then went to the window seat and ate my ice cream while browsing on my phone. After a few minutes I saw one of the employees walk in my direction, looking pissed off.


Employee: ""Hey why are you just sitting there, it's not your lunchbreak yet!""

Me: ""What? I don't work here, what do you mean?""

Employee: ""Of course you do, I see you here every day!""

Me: ""Yes, I eat ice cream here every day during my LUNCH BREAK. I work over there at (my company)""

Employee: ""Wait. What's your name?""

Me: ""(tells my name)""

Employee: ""Oh I'm sorry I thought you were Nia!""

Me: ""Who's Nia??""

Employee: ""Doesn't matter, you look so much alike. You have the same exact haircut! and probably the same 
height too. And Nia has that shirt as well!""


At that point I didnt even answer anymore, I just wanted to leave, so I stood up and excused myself, but not before getting interrupted again.

Employee: ""Oh I know. You should just get a haircut and I won't mistake you two again! Or dye your hair differently""

Me: ""... You know, maybe you should dye your hair neon pink so I immediately know when not to come in anymore.""


After that I ignored her indignant face and walked out. Haven't been back since.

About 2 months ago, I received a call that my MIL had been hospitalized unexpectedly.  She's looking 100 in the eye so we take it seriously when we get a call.

When I arrived at the hospital,  I had several people ask for directions. I was puzzled and explained I was a visitor.  No biggie. They just looked at me funny. When I arrived on the floor, a visitor was irritated because I could not tell her who her mother's nurse was.  By now I'm confused.  I occasionally wear scrubs in public, even other hospitals without drawing attention. 

Turns out I was wearing a blue scrub top and black scrub pants.  This happens to be the RN uniform for the whole hospital.  Same color, same brand even. Their blue tops had the hospital logo, otherwise same.

The unit nurses had a great sense of humor. They knew I couldn't have worn their uniform if I tried.  Sheer goofy coincidence.  

MIL was fine. Her roommate, who was also not young, could not understand why I couldn't take care of her too.  I didn't stay long because of the confusion.  I'm a nurse, but not your nurse and not in CT.

The employees at the aquarium wore blue jackets and dark blue lanyards. 



My boyfriend and I took my niece and nephew to the aquarium today. While we were there my niece and I went to look at fishes that were kept in a darker area. We stopped to look at some clown fish who were chilling in some anemone. At my job I get to read a lot of weird informational stories. Including a story about how clown fish and anenomes work together. 



My niece is 7 and loves to learn about things. So I started explaining to her how they work together. While I was explaining to her a guy and girl walked up to the tank we were looking at. When I finished the guy asked me if they had to feed the anemone and I just said ""No idea."" 



The guy stopped and looked at me very confused. At this point I figured he just thought I was an anemone expert and tried to explain that I had only read about it at my job. Once I mentioned my job he looked me up and now a couple times.

So I go in & as I'd miss the bus my co-workers say if I wait for them we'll share a taxi like the old days. Yep dripping with wholesomeness. Anyway they go off to work & me to do my shop. When in walks Annie, now Annie needed help getting her shop. I was a cashier so rarely did, but had planned to my last shift, unfortunately she didn't make it in. 

So I go up to her, she asks about work & I tell her good it's better hours, more responsibility but it's all good. I ask if I can help her with her shop & even said I had to get some bits for my mum. Which lead to still at home? How are you parents? I'd worked their 4 years & she liked to talk, asked if I was still going steady, which lead to talk of the holiday me & my boyfriend back then were taking. She was hoping to see her grandkids in December for Christmas, it had been 18 months since she'd seen them. But that's what happens when you leave home. (No your daughter should've been called Karen, there's a Reddit for her...) But it was all friendly. 

Having gotten are things she insisted I go first, I told the cashier I'd help Annie if she'd let me. Instead of one of the boys who we joked were her boyfriends that I looked after & kept out of trouble. So after packing my bags & paying I packed hers & placed them in the trolley. Saying I'd be back for mine....

When she left this shop she always went for a tea in McD afterwards, so we'd leave her there & staff there helped her into a taxi outside at the rank. So we get there & she thanks me, saying she's missed me & thought I'd left! 

""I did, about 3 weeks ago remember"" I assumed old age...
Annie looked so embarrassed ""Really I thought so but then you came to help me I thought I must be confused. It happens you know to people my age. Oh dear you left your shopping."" 
""It's fine I'm getting a taxi with your boyfriends, they'll look after it.""
""They bloody better or I'll finish with them..thank you for helping me, you didn't have to.""
""It was a pleasure Annie I wanted to before I left, at least now I don't have to rush off.""
So we passed a few more minutes just catching up & being quizzed about where I DID work now. Turns out she'd found out I was leaving & like the rest of the staff thought my last shift was Saturday not Thursday. No way was I getting rotten egged when I had an hour to get home changed & out! Dutiful girlfriend had football or something to watch. 

I didn't work there anymore but I was always grateful I got to serve Annie once more. 

I saw Annie at my new work after that, a few times. If it was quiet we caught up, if not just a quick wave. I'm also pretty sure her grandkids came to visit. I know they got their presents & loved them. My new job meant I found her lots of deals & my discount off cool gadgets & stuff. The time spent hunting in the stock room for her & checking deliveries for the big must have kids toy, bloody Furbies..... was worth it just to hear her describe her grandchildren's faces. The way she lit up, the way only doting grandmas do.

Anyway I hope some of you like it. Who knows maybe the Grinch might read it, & there heart might grow. Failing that they're entitlement might shrink. 

Like I said this is in honor of another post so please give there's a read too."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cxzpx8/hes_no_tour_guide_lady/,"He's no tour guide lady A few summers ago, me, my sister, and a few cousins had travelled to this large coastal city where my Dad lived. He took us on a ferry ride that shows tourists around some iconic areas, including a military port, retired military ships, famous buildings, etc.

My Dad being an ex-merchant marine and a trivia buff began pointing out the buildings and ships and sharing interesting information about them. Us kids were wide eyed and busy snapping pictures. 

What we didn't notice was that another family had joined our group and were hanging on to my Dad's every word.

When there was a lull in the information, the mother in that family asked me, ""Where did you find a guide? We had been asking around, but we couldn't find anyone!"" It was true that there was no such service.

I said, ""He's not a guide, he's just my dad!""

""That can't be right. How does he know all that information? Does he work as a guide?""

I was too flustered to answer back wittily. ""He's just Dad. He knows stuff!""

She huffed, but continued listening to Dad as something new came up.

The family moved aside soon after the ferry began turning back. I suspected because they didn't want my Dad to ask them for money for his service, though I can't be sure.

Dad, on the other hand, was completely oblivious. He was surprised when I told him of the incident. He hadn't even noticed them. Then he said something like, ""I'm glad I got to teach them something.""

Lord bless him."

Yesterday at about 2:30 I was shopping at my local smiley face box store. As I usually do I stop and check their app to figure out what aisle stuff is on since they did a reset a few months ago, and I haven’t yet become accustomed to the layout.

While standing in the aisle searching the app, I hear a very loud throat clearing sound. It was at that point I knew I had my opportunity to try a new tactic. We all saw how verbally obscene I have been in the past. This time I was going to play nice.

This lady didn’t look like the stereotype Karen, she had red highlights and curly hair. Let’s call her K. And to be open I’m wearing a green shirt with a Minecraft creeper on it.

K: ahem! Excuse me! Hey! (No there were no pauses)

Her hand was on her hip, and her head was tilted in that I’m about to go off on you way that Karen’s get before threatening a manager.


M: Yes?

K: I’ve been waiting over here for 10 minutes.

I cut her off mid sentence. I felt a bit cheeky.

Me: Oh my goodness. I’m sorry you had to wait. Why didn’t you get my attention sooner. Since your here now, can you check the back for this homedic foot spa? The app said you have one In stock, but the slot is empty.

K: I.. uh.. you’re supposed to be helping me.

Me: I am? Well I guess I can go back with you to check. I’m not exactly sure how that would work, but I’m game.

K: excuse me?  Your the one who works here.

Me: Pretty sure I don’t. However, judging by your blue shirt, your the employee I requested 15 minutes ago.  Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait that long for a employee? Then have them lie and say they don’t work here?

K: I don’t work here dumbass. What are you even talking about?

Me: Well then why would you come up to a customer who is obviously waiting on somebody and then tell them you had been waiting for their attention for 10 minutes?

K: I didn’t.

Me: Yes, you did. Now don’t lie to me twice. Do we need to get your manager up here?

At this point she lets out the loudest “hmmph” type of sound and walks out mouthing something under her breath. 

I continued my shopping and ultimately checked out. Probably the most fun I’ve ever had diffusing a situation without the use of profanity, and without an actual employee getting involved.

Update: Corrected a bit of grammar.

Update 2: Thank you all so much for the gold and silver, and a big thank you to the platinum. I did not expect any of that from this post."

About 18 years ago when I was in high school and *heavy* into the teenage goth life style. I'm talking sideways haircut with dyed black hair. Enough black eye makeup to make a raccoon look at me funny. And dressed to the top with 48"" wide bottom pants with a few dozen pockets and chains that served no function. A black too tight tee with a weird saying and enough necklaces on I'm surprised I didn't cause neck damage.

At the mall with friends because there's nothing else to do in the early 2000's in the suburbs. We head to the nearest bathroom, which is inside a department store. I don't have to go so I wait outside on one of the display beds. When a woman comes up and begins asking me questions. Cue me looking over my shoulder and all around to see that I'm the only one she could be talking to. I just answered in my most sarcastic ""I hate the world and everyone in it"" tone of voice.

I find a nice button down collared shirt (in the suit section) but its' pretty wrinkled.

I was wrong.

I'm on mobile so I apologize for the formatting and I will try my best to keep grammar mistakes to a minimum. I am so sorry for how long it turned out to be but I'm still kind of embarrassed with how I reacted so my typing is a little frantic. 

So for the cast you've got ME as myself, DK for Dumb Karen, WE for Walmart Employee , and FM for my Former Manager.

So this week I actually get to be home for a few days. I am an over the road truck driver that runs a dedicated load every week across country and nowhere near hom. My co driver aka my dad and I pretty much run 40+ weeks out of the year and usually take a solid month off or so when we want to be home or go on vacation out of the country. Any other time it is just a day or two here and there when we can just happen to get to town. But this time we got to go home for a solid week. You know what that means? Home cooked meals! I love to cook and so to do so I needed fresh groceries. 
Stupid me decided to run to Walmart solo instead of the neighborhood grocery store down by my house and boy do I regret that now.
I actually enjoy Walmart much to everyone's shock. I am a former employee you see, an ex cashier, that according to my former coworkers have an unshakable customer service personas that couldn't be wavered by two years of retail abuse. I actually rather liked the job being the people pleaser (masochist) that I am and I had quite a number of regulars and employees that I still like to chat with when I'm out shopping. 
This day I'd finished with my catching up and had moved deeply into my hunt for the ingredients I needed for a new recipe I was eager to try. I was having trouble finding a certain spice among the variety before me when it happened. The classic Karen throat clearing.
Full disclosure, I have no idea how long the woman I looked up to find glaring at me had been trying to get my attention. I had on my BlueParrott headset that I usually wear when driving and at the time was using it to ironically listen to scary Walmart stories by a Youtuber while my eyes were scanning the shelves and checking the recipe list on my phone. Needless to say I hadn't been looking for human interaction at that moment. But like usual my knee jerk customer service persona (which is just me giving a polite smile and friendly eyes) kicked in and I shifted my cart away from the shelves while also muting my phone.

ME: I'm sorry if I'm-
DK: You shouldn't ignore a customer like that. It's so unprofessional. Honestly why do they appoint barely teenagers to management. 

DK scolds me a bit more ranting about management meaning experience but really I only paid attention to the first thing she said to me. My mind had wandered of looking from her to down at myself. To her credit I was dressed ""nice"" but not exactly what I call professional with pastel pink capris, flouncy olive green blouse and shiny metallic bronze flats. What can I say? I like dressing nice and colorful when I'm not at risk of getting diesel on my clothes.
DK was a middle aged local classic pain in the behind whose sense of fashion often hurt my eyes. This one looked like she just rolled out of the trailer park wearing a camo hoodie with pink, black workout pants that probably had never seen the inside of a gym, lime green running shoes, and bottle blond hair done up in a ponytail pulled through the back of a very loved baseball cap. To complete the look she had a huge Coach purse sitting in her buggy beside her, a bag even I know cost more than her entire outfit times three. Yeah, typical Karen for where I'm from.

ME: Listen I don't work here. If you need help with something though all you need to do is press that button and it will call someone for you.
I gesture to a ""need help? call"" button located on a post about two pace behind me up the aisle. 

Usually I wouldn't mind helping someone who couldn't find something. I had former customers ask for my help all the time and if I wasn't busy and they were nice( or just elderly, I was a big hit with the elderly because I'm a sucker for little old ladies). So far DK wasn't any of those things and she had a perfume on that was making my nose itch so I was hoping to shoo her away. No such luck. DK scowls at my suggestion. 

DK: Why are you lying?! You work here. You've checked me out numerous times and I don't appreciate being lied to. The nerve!

To be honest I felt this mixture of confused resignation and completely dropped my smile and sighed. I'm only as nice as I want to be. In truth I have a resting bitch face that makes me very unapproachable according to my best friends. 

ME: Listen...I don't work here anymore and I'm in the middle of getting my own groceries. So let's just not?

Turning back to the shelf of spices I check my phone again before glancing over the selection before finally finding what I needed.  Just as I move to put it in my buggy and move along with my day I get a sharp nasty pain in the side of my head. I yelped, probably louder than necessary but I was so caught off guard by the pain that I didn't care. Plus I am very tender headed. 
See apparently the DK was not happy with me and grabbed ahold of my headset and yanked it off my head. Unfortunately for me I have very thick very wavy hair that for some reason other people envy. Not me though and especially not when the head rest of my headset tangled in my hair from the way she tried to snatch it off and instead she ended yanking and pulling out more than a few strands of my hair. Even with such a yank she didn't manage to free if from my hair and just ended up dropping it causing the headset to tangle further in my hair and cause gravity to yank my hair mercilessly again. Most people would have stopped and apologized after realizing what they've done, not DK though.

DK: Don't you dare walk away from me! How dare you speak to me that way! I don't care if you're management now or what, you still work at fucking Walmart. You're still not as important as me.

Her last comment made me pause in the midst of me trying to free my hair from my headset, eyes watering, scalp throbbing. I always have hated how people looked down on people working at Walmart. Majority of the cashiers and floor associates that I knew at this store were either students or were retired professional like teachers, nurses, office workers. Most of our older staff were just part timers to have something to do. I was pissed  

Me: I. Don't. Work. Here.
DK: Not this again. I told you-
Me: I. Don't. Work. Here. I! Don't! Work! Here! I DON'T WORK HERE! I DON'T WORK HERE! 

I just kept repeating myself getting louder and louder until I was practically screaming at her making her back away from me. Something I had learned early on as a child was that I was the last kind of person people expected to hear yell. I don't know if it's the way I look or just a vibe I give off, I don't know, but either way I've learned to use it to my advantage to get people to back off. 
But the screaming also started to draw attention to us as people started coming into the aisle to see what was happening. Among the people included a Walmart employee I was familiar with even though she started after I left and my former manager. By the time they showed I had finished screaming and was now just glaring at the shell shocked and probably embarrassed DK who was red in the face.

WE: What's going on here? Is someone hurt?

DK points a finger at me first as I'm catching my breath and have started fiddling with my hair again trying get it untangled. 

DK: This girl went crazy when I tried to ask her where something is, and started screaming in my face and even swung at me! She needs to go to jail or at least be fired.

By the end of her speech big crocodile tears were streaming down her face and one of the random customers who had come to watch was patting her shoulder and trying to console her. The WE and FM turn to me just as I finally get my headset free with a good clump of hair still wrapped around the head rest and look up meeting their gazes. 

FM: OP are you alright? What happened? Why were you screaming? What's with all the hair?

FM, bless her, didn't even wait for my response (I really wasn't in the state of mind to give one as I tend to go mute when I get very very upset) as she looked from my distraught face to my hands still holding the headset and mess of hair hanging limply from it before turning back to DK who was quietly regaling some of the crowd with just how horrific I had been.

FM: Excuse me, but can you tell me what happened again and also perhaps tell me why OP is holding a chunk of her hair?
DK: What about her hair? I told you, she attacked me! I'm the victim here. Are you believing her over me because she is you employee?
WE: That still doesn't answer her question. Did you pull out OP's hair? What kind of person does that?

The crowd begins to murmur and DK obviously realizes she's losing popular opinion. In the meantime, I'm starting to calm down and rub at my scalp trying to dissipate the pain. Luckily no blood.

DK: I was, I was just asking her a question and she ignored me. I pulled off her headphones to get her to listen to me. It's not my fault she doesn't brush her hair. 

WE: That's assault! Why would you ever put your hands on someone? And now you're telling everyone that she attacked you? What's the matter with you?
FM: I think it's time we called for the sheriff's department. 

DK's eyes widened as she seemed to come to the realization that she might have screwed with the wrong person, but as I've said before, I can be nice when I want to.

ME: I'm fine. Just make her leave me alone. I don't want to spend one of my precious nights at home with a police officer unless he's buying me dinner.

This made the crowd laugh.

FM: Are you sure OP?
ME: No, but I have cold things to get home, a dinner to cook, and my Dad's probably wondering what's taking so long.

To that FM nodded and forced DK to follow her while the crowd quickly dispersed and when back to their own shopping. WE stayed with me and we chatted while I got the last few things I needed and went to checkout.  FM came up to me after I finished paying and told me she'd had the woman banned from this store. 
To be honest that really sucks for her because this is the only Walmart in this county and the closest Walmart I know of is over a forty minute drive from where I live. Apparently though I wasn't the first person she had harrassed here, although all the others had been actual employees, and the security feed that she reviewed clearly showed the woman trying to snatch off my headset. FM tells me that if it had been her she would have socked the woman in the mouth which is really surprising because FM was a former elementary school teacher who taught for close to forty years before retiring and taking up the management position to stay active and supplement her income. FM has the patience of a saint but says she wouldn't have hesitated to backhand DK after I explained to her what DK had said to me. We chatted some more, laughed a bit, and then I went home.

I'm sorry it was so long, but I just had to get it out of my system in order to  sleep tonight. I knew there were irate people in this world, but I never thought I'd meet such a self-entitled Karen in real life.


TL/DR: A woman demands I help her thinking I still worked at Walmart. When I refuse she ends up pulling out some of my hair and gets banned from the store by my awesome former manager.


UPDATE:

I take it back! I should have had her arrested the first go around. This woman has made my nice peaceful week at home a freaking nightmare. Yes, I ran into DK again today, but this time at Lowe's. 

So the new cast is DK as Dumb Karen who didn't learn her lesson the first time, ME for myself, AD for my Awesome Dad (and boss), LE for Lowe's Employee that I know, and LM for Lowe's Manager who I am familiar with.

So I decided to run another errand while I was home for the week. This time it was to Lowe's to pick up some mulch for AD's newly built raised flowerbeds and a few odds and ends like metal piping, spray paint, and screws for a home project I decided to start. AD is a few aisles over from me picking up the spray paint  while I was looking at screws and chatting with LE for a few minutes about my cat. I own a Sphynx cat, a hairless cat, named Pan, who will go with me anywhere if I'd let him. Since Lowe's is pet friendly he usually tags along with me every trip and sits in the child seat without complaint the whole time. All of the staff here adore him and are constantly stopping me for a visit and a chat, LE being the most often to visit because her section is right next to the main entrance. After LE leaves to check her section, but not before promising to bring back some cat treats for Pan, I turn my attention back to the screws. 
I kid you not, mere seconds after LE leaves I hear someone growl out, ""You!"" I turn around wide eyed to find DK standing there behind her cart glaring at me. Let me note before this exchange that I am wearing jean shorts, a red blouse with a bandana print, flip flops, and and my hair pulled up with a scrunchie. I was the definition of nonprofessional attire and I certainly don't look like a Lowe's associate.

DK: So! This is where you work!
ME: Sorry?
DK: Oh, you will be sorry! Where is your manager! I demand you ge t him for me now! I want you fired after what you did to me the other day!

I'll admit I wasn't on my best game in this moment. It had been a long day. AD and I had spent most of it out in the yard checking on the progress of the lawn (we had laid grass seed before we went back to work at the end of May) and also shoving soil into the raised flowerbeds. I was sun tired and this woman had enough malice to knock the wind out of you sails.

ME: I don't work here either lady.
DK: Liar, I saw you talking with your coworker.  No one talks that much with staff unless you're an employee. Now get me your manager! Now!

Her comment really irritated me. By her logic I should also work at the bank, the water company, the electric company, the Dollar General, Whitt's Barbecue, the Pilot, and pretty much everywhere else that I run errands in town. Especially the places I take Pan. He's  such a well behaved baby and an easement for people to approach me and strike up conversation. Plus I really do enjoy talking with people. But this woman, this woman acted like anyone working or making a living was beneath her. It disgusted me.

ME: Are you deaf? I don't work here, and LE and I were just talking about my baby here.
DK: Baby?

Confused DK peeks around me at Pan sitting there doing his best yoga pose with back leg thrown high in the air while he cleaned his leg. DK shrieks making me step back into the shelves because damn I was not expecting that. Meanwhile Pan doesn't even acknowledge her, he's too busy cleaning and used to loud noises from living on a truck.

DK: What is that hideous creature?! 
ME: Whoa, whoa, hang on wait a mi-
DK How dare you bring that disgusting thing in a store! It's a naked rat!
ME: It's my cat, you dumbass!

I actually think the woman was getting ready to throw something at me and/or Pan if LE didn't appear coming up the aisle followed by AD.

LE: Ma'am would you pleas calm down? OP what's going on?
DK:  This girl brought a disgusting creature into this store! Get me a manager! I want her fired and banned? 
LE: Disgusting? 
AD: Fired?
LE: Ma'am, this is a pet friendly store and Pan Pan is a welcome guest. He may be unusual looking but he is a very good fur baby.
DK: That thing is an abomination! What if children saw it! It's licking it's junk.

Well that was true, Pan had moved farther south with his cleaning and was still completely oblivious to the crazy lady. While LE was defending my little Pan's honor AD nudged me to get my attention. 

AD: What the hell's going on with this woman?
ME: Remember that stupid woman I told you about that thought I still worked at Walmart?
AD: The one that pulled out you hair when she tried to snatch off your headset.
ME: Uh huh.

And that is when AD's eyes went from mildly annoyed to fully pissed off. I wish there was an analogy for dads like their is for moms. You know: tiger mom or momma bear. AD really deserves one, especially when he's upset on my behalf. AD has big heart and is a surrogate dad to any and all who need one, but biologically I am his only child. I am his number one priority. And DK dared to mess with me.

AD: Tell LE to get her manager.

He steps forward, calling for DK's attention who is still ranting about Pan (another bad move on her part because my dad refers to him as his grandbaby).

ME: I am OP's boss. What exactly did she do to you?

DK gets this smug grin on her face for a minute as she looks from LE to ME and then back to AD. It's then that her face twists into this stricken expression as she recounts to AD how I harrassed her in Walmart a couple of days ago and got her thrown out of the store because I was friends with management, and how I had spotted her today and started threatening her and taunting her and yelling at her to get out of the store. Geez this woman had a screw loose. I managed to mumble to LE to go fetch the manager towards the beginning of her story and LE scurried off, coming back fairly quickly with her manager in tow just as DK was demanding AD to kick me out and how she couldn't believe employees acted like this and brought ugly animals to their place of work. LM stepped up looking around at our little group slight confused, apparently LE had only told him a customer was harassing another customer and to hurry.

LM: I'm the shift manager, what seems to be the problem here.
AD: Yeah, sorry to bother you but this woman came up and started screaming at my daughter. She assaulted her at the Walmart on Friday and got banned from the store. Now she seems to think she can get my daughter banned from here in return so she's making up wild accusations. 

DK's jaw drops at my AD's calm, albeit stern explanation as she looks between me and him. I don't know how she didn't realize he was my dad. I bare a stiking resemblance to him  although most people say we look the most alike when we smile and we weren't smiling right now.

DK: Your daughter?! I thought you said you were her manager?!
AD: No, I said I was her boss, which I am. She does not work here or at Walmart. 
DK: You...you!

DK made a strangled sound in her throat, her face turned almost purple in shade. Whatever she wanted to say I guess words couldn't convey because suddenly she launched herself at us arms raised, fingers curled like claws ready to scratch our eyes out. AD was too quick for her though as he shoved me out of the way and side stepped her causing DK to run full force into the shelf behind us. She's lucky the lower drawers kept her from impaling herself in the eye with the hanging racks. Judging by her screams though I'm pretty sure she scratched the hell out of her arms though as she fell back onto the floor none too gently. DK began shouting assault and for help and of course for the police. She got her wish. 
LM radioed for security and in less then a minute two guy were hauling a screeching and cursing DK up and marching her towards the front of the store. The police were called and what should have been a thirty minute shopping trip turned into an hour and a half long ordeal of speaking with the multiple managers, giving our statements to the police, watching DK lose it on the police and have to be tasered in order to be handcuffed, and agreeing that this time yes, I wanted to press charges. They took security tapes and I gave them the name of my former manager from Walmart to contact confirming the earlier incident as well as see about getting their security tapes as well. We then finally got to pay for our stuff, LM insisting on giving us 10% off our final purchase price for all the trouble, plus he knew from working with us in the past just how much we'd spent at his store in the last year while we've been landscaping AD's new property. That made AD very happy and he's spent the last couple hours calling up his buddies and telling them about the lunatic at Low's and how he got a discount. He's a simple person to please. I wish he wouldn't have told his wife though because she got very upset and worried about us (it's her normal state) and demanded for us to leave the rest of the yard work and my project until tomorrow and to just relax for the rest of the night. 
We obliged her and I'm taking part of my ""resting time"" to write this update. I'm so shocked by this woman. I have never been spoken to by a stranger like this outside of my stint doing retail. Is this just how some people are? God I hope she gets help. 

She won't be finding it at Lowe's though because we were assured that DK was banned from there as well and as a side note Lowe's is also the only home improvement store in our county. The next available one is a Home Depot about a thirty minute drive up the interstate. 
Sucks to be her."

This happened a few weeks ago at a Walmart.


My job like almost any other when it comes to uniform, except mine happen to be all navy blue, Polo with company logo and Cargo pants for tools and such.

I was stocking up on new tools and decided to grab a water on my way to the check out, now I'm wearing the afformentioned uniform, with slides and a pair of headphones, I had grabbed the bottle from the top shelf and as I was pulling it down I felt a tap on my shoulder, it was some lady and her two adult kids(?)

And she began to speak, I was kind of unsure where this was going as there shouldn't be a reason for her to even speak to me, let alone touch me.

She said ""Do you know where the motor oil for a differential engine is?""

My eyes when a little wide and I looked around and shrugged ""I'd guess in automotive? I don't know I don't work here."" 

She looked honestly offended, like some stupid walmart employee was trying to just be lazy and not help her, she then pulled her glasses down and leaned in to look at my company's logo on my shirt, covered her mouth as her companions laughed abit and she muttered ""I'm too embarrassed to speak"" I kind of laughed a bit before taking off.

I think if I keep testing this water by accident I'll end up having some Karen explode on me one day, so I'll remember to post that should it ever happen."

**tl;dr: I helped a mawmaw decide which panty liners were best for bladder leakage and it took longer than expected because she wanted to ""talk it out"" with me, but over all wasn't a bad experience.**

So the other day I went to the neighborhood  food market that does not apparently sell walls despite being a mart for them... Anywho I had just picked up my toddler from MDO and had to get some stuff before heading home to get big kiddos off the bus and get ready for work (I work nights 6:30p-7a and it's now about 2:30pm). So in my head it would be a quick trip - get the stuff for tacos and a few things we needed for the next day and get home. 

I am in the baby aisle looking at something, which at the end of the aisle is another wall of stock - feminine products and next to them a bit was the incontinence pads and diapers. I see an older woman(prob in her 70s or so) looking at me and my daughter, smiling. I thought it was because of our interactions, since my kid is super dang adorable and quite friendly  Anywho, as I finish, this woman asks if I can help her, I reply ""I may be able to, but I make no promises!"" 

So she gestures to the incontinence stuff and mentions something about Poise, which isn't on the top shelf but I assumed maybe she had limited ROM in her shoulders and couldn't reach it. Turns out she didn't know what to get and wanted to see what I thought. She had some regular panty liners in the basket that were from the period section but wasn't sure if they would be good, or if she should try another brand, she thinks this brand was the one she had at home now but didn't really like it, and she didn't want the diapers (don't blame you, they can be a pain to work with), her grand daughter usually does this for her but she's in Montana on vacation. In my head I'm like ""Jesus, I am going to be late getting home, but I took care of my mawmaw and if mine went shopping on her own and needed help I'd hope someone would help her - F me and my weakness for mawmaws)

Well, I actually use the panty liners she had in her basket for kind of the same reason - I work 12 hour shifts and it's in a super busy NICU so using the bathroom isn't always possible, so I explain to her that I can't tell her much about the other brands but I use these exact pads when I'm at work and they hold up pretty well over 12 hours of standing/moving/squatting/etc, and I may change it but usually don't. So we're done, right? I've given you my opinion, said I don't really have anything to say on the others, so I'm good to go. Nope. Still not sure. Let's discuss it and compare. *sigh* okay... i guess I have about 10 or so minutes to spare... 

So we discuss various options and look at the different types and claims and compare, while reminding her I don't want to tell her for sure which is better because I only have experience with this one brand and only really need them occasionally, and that it matters whether or not you're able to change them often. Eventually we decide that she would try the ones she had and if she felt they were too short she could double them, and if she didn't like them, she could give them to her grand daughter or another woman in her family who still has their cycle. 

It took a bit longer than I'd really want, but she was really kind and I think just needed a ""grand daughter"" to talk it out with."

TL;DR: I looked like a city worker and got told by Karen to clean up a dead fish on the beach. I gave Karen the number to the place I really work and my boss took it from there

Cast: K=Karen and Me=Me

So, I'm working at my local fire department in their internship program. My job is to put up beach flags and check the flags regularly based on the weather. (If you dont know what I mean by beach flags, they're colored flags that symbolize the level of danger that the water poses. Green=Safe, Yellow=Caution, and Red=Dont Swim) I live in a tourist town along one of the Great Lakes, so there are a lot of entitled tourists that visit. The process of checking the flags is to drive by the beaches and evaluate if the color of the flag matches the current water conditions. 

The story starts with me going about my normal business. I'm driving along one of the beaches, just doing my job. It was a particularly hot day out that day, so there were many people swimming. As I'm about to leave and go to the next beach, I get signalled down by the Karen. I pull over and see what she needs from me. 

K: Hello, excuse me? You look like a city worker, can you help me?

I'm driving a Mule, which is a glorified golf cart, and wearing a reflective vest, so I guess that's where she got that from

Me: (cluelessly) Sure, what is it?

K: I've been calling the city maintenance department for the past hour trying to get someone down here, and you just about drove away! Your supervisor will be hearing about this!

Me: I'm sorry about that, but I dont work for the city. What seems to be the problem?
(I guess I might work for the city, but I'm officially employed by the fire dept.)

K: Theres a dead fish on the shore barely ten feet from where my family is trying to enjoy our vacation. Get rid of it! 

Me: I cant take care of that, but I can try and get a hold of who can. 

K: No, I've been calling for an hour now! My family's vacation is being ruined because of you now!!!

Me: I'm sorry, but this is not my job. I'm not a mantainence person. I put up the beach flags. 

K: I dont care! Go clean that up before I decide you dont work here anymore.

I then gave her the number to our department and promptly left her in the dust. While I was leaving and heading to the next beach, I gave my boss a call and a heads up about the momzilla that was about to call him and ""decide I dont work for him anymore""

My boss answered her call shortly after I warned him about her and he chewed her out for harassing me and thinking that she could fire any teenager she wanted to. Him and I had a good laugh about that later on."

Hey all, Been reading too many posts on here so i decided to post my little story that happened years ago when i was in my young 20's.

Bit of a back story first....

I did have much money and had a Rover 600 and it was a couple years old, Rover is far from the best cars on the road but i like it and had fitted a massive sound system in it plus it was startig to look like i had crashed into a branch of Halfords with a spoiler, lowered suspension and alloys along with red viper strips over it.

Being a Rover, it was not the most reliable car i ever owned but it got me from A to B ok but was in the Local Garage every few months with something that had gone wrong with it.

As you would expect, a couple of the lads that worked in there were my age and were into car modding etc, so we became quite good friends over the years and got on well with the manager too as i was allowed to use thier ramps on a couple of occassions to do other stuff to me motor.

Would quite reguarlly sit behind the counter while have a coffee waiting while they fix the latest issue.

This one morning, a 70+ year old walks in and asks how you use the air machine as he wants to pump up his tyres.

Now, This is a franchised Ford repair garage and the air machine he wants help with is in the supermarket petrol station over a busy main road.

Its quicker to walk to the actully petrol station office than it is to wait for the traffic lights to go red for you to use the pedestrain crossing to get into this Garage.

The Manager of the garage very politely advises the bloke that its the petrol stations air machine not ours so you need to go in there.

He then goes on for 5 minutes getting increasingly agitated saying that they are both owned by the same people?

( yeah, that should of been a red flag right there!!!!)

Me, after finishing my third coffee, decided sod it, ill walk over with him and help him, not like i can go anywhere with 2 wheels off and the car!

I walk over the bloke and start to set the machine ie PSI, and took the dust caps off the first wheel to check it PSI when he comes running around, stops me and asks how im doing it.

Ok, ill show him so he would know next time - yeah,  bad mistake.

I showed him several times how to change the settings on the machine, theres 3 buttons, 1 to change between the pressure reading, it was PSI and a second one i dont remember and then a + and - button to set the desired pressure.

Now i dont know if he had medical issues or what but he just cant seem to understand what to do and is now starting to shout at me really loudly and we have only managed to do 1 wheel so far.

I think, Fuck it!! i shout back at him and say i came down to help you as a favour, i dont work here and your shouting at me, go fuck yourself!! and walk about 200 meters back over the road and tell the Manager what had just happened and sat down.

Yep - think you see whats coming next..................

2 minutes later, He comes storming in, screaming and shouting at me, calling me every name under the sun plus a few ive never heard before ( see, can always learn things from the older gents!!hahahaha) demanding im fired on the spot!

He asks for the manager, who was standing right by me, and he tries to tell him on more than a dozen occassions that i dont work here and im actully  customer, also explained that the air machine is in the supermarket petrol station and is nothing to do with them and i had helped out the goodness of my heart.

At this point, all the mechanics have come into the office from the workshops and are standing there listen to the man and manager having it out asking me what the hell happened!!!

Eventually, the crazy ass walked out saying he would be calling the head office to make a complaint, Did ask the manager a couple times if anyone did complain but never did.

Now, Did he call the Ford head office or the Supermarket headoffice?? guess we will never know!! hahahaha"

So I work in an inbound call centre, so for all intents and purposes when you call us we ""are"" the company unless extremely provoked we'll admit we are a third party whom take messages/orders/contact engineers etc.

We take calls for 100's if 1000's of clients all of them are scripted and we have general knowledge of some accounts; others barely anything but as of yet I've only taken a few calls where someone has called me out on not working for the company.

So I'm working my usual shift it's coming up to 19:00 a call drops in and I say the opening line on the script. Hello this xyz company, muffmunncher speaking how can I help?

Gentleman- what is your name (screeching at this point)

Me; Muffmunncher

Gentleman - and your surname 

Me; My initial is J for Juliet 

Gentleman; no your name

Me; unfortunately we don't give surnames in this office ( if it's not scripted I ain't telling yah )

Gentleman ; where are you based?

Me; I'm in the Hammersmith office.

Gentleman; so you dont work for xyz company because they're based in Quebec so you're a scam company who has taken my details. I want your name and your managers name and  I will report you to the police.

Me; Sir I can get my manager on the phone, but we do work for xyz company as the order and payments line.

Gentleman; You deaf bitch you listen to me -

Me; sir if you continue to use that language I'll have to terminate the call.

Gentleman; it is your job to solve my issue, you best damn well get your manager on the phone and I'm recording this call to hand into the (Marketing authority) and making a claim against you.

I'm immediately taken aback by this.

Me; All of our calls are recorded sir, and your making a claim against myself specifically, is that what you're stating.

He called back several times to my colleagues quoting my name asking to speak to my manager and make a formal complaint. We had to eventually bite the bullet and state that were a 3rd party we take calls for xyz company and reiterate exactly what I'd already told to him.

A few days go by and we get an email from xyz company saying the crazy gentleman had written in with my details and had stated that he wanted my personal details so he send them to the Marketing authority for breach of Data protection laws.

They sent a picture of the letter they returned.

""She doesn't work here.""

TLDR: Man wants me to remove him from the mailing list, swears at me when I explain I am not able to. Threatens to sue and report me to the police. Calls back several times and we explain we're not actually the company. Sends a letter to the company asking for my details, only to be told I don't work there."

A slight twist on the “I don’t work here lady” scenario.

This happened about 2 years ago.

The restaurant that I work in is a small family-owned place. Very nice food (with pretty high prices and extremely good reviews).

One week, on a Thursday, the Maitre d’ is taken to Hospital with appendicitis, so naturally he couldn’t work on his regular shifts on Friday and Saturday night, so I tell everyone I’ll do it and fill in for him.

Friday evening I’m waiting tables, operating the cash register and acting as Maitre d’ as are the other two waiters, Dave and Phil (As I said – it’s a small place. We all chip in).

The really busy period of the evening is winding down and things are a little quieter. I’m just greeting a couple and checking their reservation, when a group of five women come in the front door, all dressed in business attire. ‘Power’ suits etc.

Cast: Me = me (I’m also ‘Chris’ in this story– not my real name), Leader = Senior ‘Karen’, Dave = one of the other waiters, KIT’s = Karens In Training.

Leader of the Pack is the archetypal ‘Karen’ and I’m guessing is about 45 to 48 years old. The other four women are KIT’s (Karens In Training) and look to be in their early to mid-30’s. ‘Leader’ is obviously the most senior and more dominant of the group.

As they are waiting for me to finish with the couple who were in front of them, the Leader is saying loudly to the other 4. “Yes, this is an *extremely* good restaurant. *Fantastic* food. It has great reviews in all the newspapers and magazines. A bit pricey, but well worth it. But that’s no problem, because it’s all going on the Corporate Credit Card, right girls?” The KIT’s all laugh at this.

Then she goes on to describe the restaurant in really glowing terms. In fact she was pretty much quoting word-for-word a favourable review the restaurant got in a travel magazine about a month before. It’s like she had committed the review to memory or something. And then she finished with “I eat here ALL the time whenever I’m in town. I’m a regular”. I thought that was strange as I don’t ever remember seeing her in the restaurant. Oh well, no matter.

After seating the couple that had come in before them, I return to the Karens at the front desk, smile and say “Good evening Ladies. Welcome to XYZ Restaurant. How may I help you?”

Leader says “We want a table for 5”. I reply “Certainly, Ma’am. Do you have a booking?” . . Leader says “No”. 

I say “Sorry ladies, but at the moment we are fully booked. However, if you would like to wait at the bar or perhaps come back in about 45 minutes, I’ll get you seated as soon as I can”

Leader says loudly “No! You will seat us NOW. I made arrangements with the OWNER for a table tonight!” I ask “When did you speak to the owner about making a reservation?” She quickly looks at the KITs and with a really smug expression says “Wednesday afternoon. I came in *personally* to speak to the owner. He’s a VERY good friend of mine. If you’re too STUPID to get it organised, he’s not going to be very pleased when I tell him about your incompetence!” This sends the 5 KITs into fits of giggling, while Leader looks proud of her dominance. 

I say “Oh. OK. I think I understand”

Leader says “You don’t look smart enough to understand *anything*” More giggles from KITs.

Just then, Dave, one of the other waiters, comes out of the kitchen and walks past. I call him over and introduce him to the group. “Ladies. I would like you to meet Dave. He has worked as a waiter here for 7 years.” . . The women don’t look impressed.

Then I say, “Dave. . . Who owns this restaurant?”. . Dave looks really puzzled for a few seconds and then says. . . “Err. . . You do Chris.”

I then turn to the group and repeat, “Sorry ladies, but at the moment we are fully booked. However, if you would like to wait at the bar or perhaps come back in about 45 minutes, I’ll get you seated as soon as I can”

Leader says in a huff “Come on girls! We’re leaving! The food here is horrible and overpriced anyway!” and they all leave. Don’t know if they had a ‘booking’ arranged with the ‘owner’ at another restaurant or if they ate fast-food that night. 

Don’t know, don’t care!

Yes – I am the owner. . Well - it’s *really* mostly owned by my parents and I have a minor share in the business, but my parents had kind-of retired a few years before and they left the day-to-day running of the business to me and would only come in about once a month for a couple of hours, mainly to catch up with old friends who are regular patrons. So for all intents I am the “owner” . .  Yes - and I pitch in and wait tables when needed.."

This is meant years ago back in high school in 2008. I'm latino, but not Mexican though I love burritos. Dialogue is mostly summarised since it was a long time. 

I used to study in a city with many big companys' European HQ offices and many entitled people, i just did my thing with the other foreigners. There was a food truck in the city center (for non EU people, EU cities typically have a center in which the rest of town revolves around filled with shops) which sold Mexican food. Being one of the few latinos there I made friends with them and sometimes offered to help making burritos. I was mostly making them and not dealing with customers. I stopped working there a year before graduation but the day i  graduated i went to give the good news to my friends. Had a suit and all. They usually opened at 8.30am and the ceremony was at 9am. 

Enter Karen van Karens (kvk) . I recognised her as one of the moms of the kid i was graduating with and her voice brought back other memories of entitlement. As I'm greeting the boss (no one else was there yet) she comes up to me from behind and shouts:

Kvk: Hooooolaaa (insert the cringiest white accent, you know that one that tries so hard to condescend you and make you feel insignificant). Are you going to get off your high horse and make me my burrito or do you think because if your suit you're too good now to make them? I bet you saved a lot of pesos to buy it. Did you ask your grandma to make it? 

I couldn't believe what was happening so I looked at my friend and he said ""ma'am he doesn't work here, he's graduating today""

Kvk: oh! I didn't know there was a diploma for making Spanish food, congrats. Maybe this time you can make decent burritos.

As i wanted to correct her i figured today was a good day and didn't want everyone to ruin it. Now, as a food truck in a first world country there was a healthy burrito and there was an extra healthy. Healthy was veggies, nothing fried and salads. The extra healthy was for people with stomach problems so to say, it helps them to to the toilet because they put all these kind of seeds, chia, flax seeds, aloe vera, leafy greens and what not, i didn't do those my friend did and I just watched. I thought, might as well take this opportunity to learn. So I suck it up and with a smile i tell her: you're right I'm sorry, I'll get to it. Would you like a chicken burrito?

Kvk: that's more like it. And no, don't you have something less destructive to the world?

Me: we have an extra healthy burrito if you'd like, it has-

Kvk: i know what a healthy burrito is, hurry up I need to be at a graduation for my son

In this country there is a standard of what a healthy sandwich is, everyone knows it so what I said it I guess she thought it meant the same fillings as the sandwich.

My friend looked at me and in Spanish said not to do it that it wouldn't be tasty (but he said sabroso in Spanish) and the woman heard it and i guess her limited Spanish understood it and said to hurry it up if it was as tasty as it was mentioned to be. I added all kinds of seeds and health stuff. We had laxatives for those that had too many burritos and needed to go, happened more often than I want to admit and I really wanted to put that but it might have come back to get us. The whole time she was asking why we were selling food in a food truck and why we didn't own a restaurant? And that if we couldn't open one it's because we lacked the proper education and language skills. So, i did what I had to and added spicy sauce, you know, so that it keeps burning all day. I filled that bad boy burrito. Now the ceremony was at 9 and she had 10 mins to get back, we were 3mins walking distance because my friends knew people might be hungry after the event.

Man did she eat that burrito up. She was sweating and cussing at how spicy it was but ate it all. Told us it was not a sabroso burrito, i said burrito sabroso to correct the grammar and she said: yes, burrito sabroso! I hope you learn for next time, got a drink and scoffed at how it was not frozen cold enough for her. I told her we only had papaya juice as it also helps with digestion and well she had to drink that. 

She leaves and I change back to go to the ceremony. I don't know what happened to her as i couldn't see her at the event but later that week it went around the school that someone from company A (which many kids' parents worked at) said that someone had complained about the food truck calling it burrito sabroso and diarrhea. My friend called me after some of the kids asked him if he heard anything about it and if he could make some to prank their friends. I took pride in my last official burrito and got the blessing from my friend to use it as my own.

I can only imagine what went through if that she complained to people at work and the people told their kids. 

Long story short, don't mess with people that make your food.

Tl:dr woman insulted me on my graduation so I gave her a diarrhea inducing fire health burrito and she called it sabroso."

I turn around and start walking toward the hot foods and a second person stopped me and asked me where something was and I responded the same way. She said ""well you look like it.""

Then A THIRD person then walks up to me and informs me about a spill. 

At this point I am shocked. In the course of three minutes, I have been mistaken for an employee three time. In no way does my outfit resemble this grocery store's uniform. I am not wearing khakis or a green apron. 

I tell her the same thing I said the others and angrily she told me ""oh well I didn't know. You have an apron on.""

Well apparently guys, an apron automatically makes you an employee. I got my slice of pizza and left as fast as I could."

B:brother
Me:me...duh
EC: entitled customer
B:bob(not real name) the owner


I am a 13 yo white male and have a 16 yo brother that works a local pizzeria. In my state, the legal age to have a job is 15 yo and I was turning 14 in a month and a half. This happened a week ago. My family goes to the pizzeria every Friday, and the owners used to be our neighbors. So we were friends.


Now onto the story.


I was hanging out with my brother in the back and sometimes I help around. I went to go get a drink because my food was almost ready, when I get a tap on my shoulder


EC: excuse me, can you get me a water from the fridge? Also I’ve been waiting and I still haven’t gotten my food.


Friday nights are normally busy.


Me: sry ma’am, I don’t work here and the you can just go up to the fridge and get one, they allow it.


EC scoffs and returned back to her table while mumbling under her breath. I didn’t think much of it and went to go sit down. A few minutes later I am eating my food and she came up to me and said...


EC: you shouldn’t be eating and you should be working, now get back to work and get me my order.


I was wearing a light gray Jurassic Park shirt on and the uniform was black with the logo in the corner and the address and phone number on the back.
I looked at my family with confusion and I got up and walked to the back to get B and asked him if her order was ready and he said ya. When I came up to her saying that they will bring it out in a few moments, but that wasn’t soon enough for her...

MEC: no I want it NOW!! Get me my food or else I’ll get you fired!


Me: listen ma’am I don’t work her I’m 13 and the legal age limit to work is 14 and that is still a little under the age (my brother got the job at 14 because we know the owners) and if you aren’t happy, that’s not my problem.


EC: shut the f**k up you little c**t go get me my order NOW!!


Me: I don’t work here, I already told you that.
She grabbed a sprite and threw it at me and she missed but the can exploded all over my brand new shoes


Me: Flip you you armadillo, go suck a lemon. (I didn’t say armadillo, but I did say lemon because my parents were right next to me)
One of the cashiers saw this and went to go get bob


Bob: what is all the commotion?


EC: this retard of an employee spat at me and threw a can at me. I want him fired RIGHT.NOW!!!
Bob: ma’am he doesn’t work here
Bob is in his late 40s and has seen these kind of problems before.


EC: yes he does and I want him fired RIGHT F**KING NOW!!!
By now the whole restaurant is looking at her


Bob: I’m going to check the security cameras to see what happened
After he was done he came back and talked to the lady


Bob: (jokingly) I’m so sorry ma’am that he did that to you. I’ll fire him ASAP.
She had a smug look on her face.


Bob: you can get your food for free... at a different restaurant because I don’t tolerate s**t for garage people now get out of my restaurant!


And he proceeded to kick the lady out and she was banned from the restaurant for life.
Bob said that if I ever wanted a job here then just say the work and you can start.
So that’s my “lady I don’t work here story” and how I got a job for when I turn 14. I’m still thinking about whether I should take up this offer."

Though from a distance it does look like the uniform as I have had people ask me for help before. Luckily they realised I didn't work there and apologised. Back to the story.  When I told the lady and turned back go the cashier she moved to stand in front of me and demanded to speak to my manager. Luckily the manager was leaving the office and came over. She the. Said to him that I was rude to her and would not seat her at a table. He looked at me and told her that I wasn't an employee of the restaurant. The lady then looked closer at my top and realised that he was telling the truth. To be fair she did apologise to me. It was a genuine mistake.
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cwpn02/this_ones_kind_of_sad_and_sweet_an_interaction/,"This one's kind of sad and sweet - an interaction with my elderly neighbor. From February to September of 2018, my family (me, wife, 11-year-old daughter) hosted a 14-year-old foster child.  The kid's time with us ended last September for reasons that aren't related to this post.

Fast forward to this year -- in May, through a church connection, my family was connected to a family from another state, who had a college-age son preparing for an unpaid internship at my city's zoo. For the sake of saving money, we agreed to let him live with us as our houseguest for the summer. He would leave in the morning, and come back in the afternoon, very obviously dressed in his official uniform as a zoo employee.

My 89-year-old neighbor met him a few times.  This is a really sweet man who doesn't really track very well anymore; his daughter lives in the same house and works from home so she can help take care of him since his wife died several years ago.

Two weeks ago our houseguest left us to go back to his college in his home state.  Late last week my neighbor asked after him, wondering if we could lend him out for some house repairs.  Turns out the neighbor got our zoo-guest confused with the foster kid we'd hosted the year before, and (combined with zoo guy's work uniform) somehow got it in his head that a ""foster kid"" was actually hired live-in help.

It took a couple of conversations since then (combined with support from his daughter) to move him past his misconceptions."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cww6os/old_lady_wants_help_so_i_give_it_to_her/,"Old lady wants help, so I give it to her This was about 10 years ago, give or take, where I worked for a ""king of burgers"" fast food restaurant that was located inside a mall. Considering the mall location we had very little space to work with behind the counter, so while we didn't have an official rule about it, it was encouraged that if you were on break then you shouldn't be in the back getting in the way of other employees and giving a bad image of lazy employees to the customers.

This is where our story begins, in the middle of a shift. It was time for my lunch break, so after making myself something to eat and grabbing a drink, I decided to go off and do some quick shopping after I had eaten. I was wandering around my usual spots around the mall and eventually wandered into a f.y.e. I was taking my time browsing their CD's at the time when I hear an old woman called to me from behind with a polite ""Excuse me.""

Now for the record, at the time this happened my uniform was all black, everything from shoes to shirt. If it wasn't for the t-shirt and hat, I'd looked like I just left a funeral. Every piece of my uniform from the waist up had the logo on it where I worked on the front, but not on the back. F.y.e uniform on the other hand had light grey shirts with their logo only on the front but with lanyards around their neck for promotional materials and cheat sheets for the worker, stuff like that. Now that we have that cleared up, back to the story.

So I turned around and address her with a simple ""Yes?"" She tells me she needed help with finding a certain CD, I forget what, and I immediately understood that she thought I worked there, but considering I was a bit awkward and didn't want to risk confrontation of any kind at the time, I put on my customer service face and give her the five star treatment. I mainly did this because she was clearly out of her element and confused, probably looking for a gift for a grandchild or something, so I didn't blame her for the mix up. 

We found exactly what she was looking for very quickly, mainly because I visited the store a lot and had friends working there, so I knew my way around. I guide her to the registers and check the clock, seeing that my break was almost up, so I go to leave the store. I assume she said something about me because as I was leaving I hear my buddy at the register say loud enough for me to hear ""He doesn't work here"" so I looked back and see her looking back at me with a look I still can't explain properly to this day. Sadness? Confusion? Betrayal? I couldn't tell you and at that moment I didn't have the time to find out, so I smiled, waved a peace sign with my fingers, and took off. I made it back on time and the rest of the day went smoothly.

TL;DR I helped an old lady shop in a f.y.e and she blue screened when an employee told her I didn't work there."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cwg6wk/she_obviously_doesnt_work_here_mom/,"“She obviously doesn’t work here mom” This isn’t one of those Get Berated By Karen ™️ stories, it’s actually kinda funny. Also I’m on mobile and have no idea how formatting works yet so...sorry in advance. Not sure if this is important but we’re both 16.


So about a month ago my friend, after weeks of convincing her parents to let her have a crested gecko, finally got the okay from them so long as she went out and bought all the supplies herself, since their work schedules wouldn’t allow them to go with and help. We don’t have anywhere to buy gecko supplies where I live (the nearest place is ~50 minutes away), so she invited me to go and we made a day out of it. 


Anyways, the only place anywhere near us that had stuff for geckos was the PetSmart of the nearby city, so we had no choice but to go there. My mom also gave me $20 to buy my dog a new rubber Kong bone since he had destroyed his old one (a little important later). 


Once we got to the PetSmart, we started filling a cart up with all the supplies she would need for her gecko based on the research she had done. We got to where the heat lamps were and she was stumped. There were a bunch of different ones and she couldn’t remember exactly which kind she needed. 


I assured her that it was no problem, she could do a quick google search and I would go and find the bone for my dog quick. With that, I left to go to the other side of the store.


I hadn’t been to this PetSmart in a while, so I wasn’t sure where exactly these bones were, or if they even had them since we ordered his last one online. I just walked to the dog toy section and started looking. In the middle of my endeavor, I accidentally hit a few things off one of the racks, and so I started to pick them back up. I noticed a lady watching me out of the corner of my eye, and I thought that was a little strange, but I’m not one for confrontation so I decided to let it slide, besides, I figured she probably wasn’t even looking at me, just scanning the isle. 


When I finished I found the dog bone, and happily retreated out of the isle, where I almost ran into the lady who was watching me, and had an amazing interaction with her and her daughter.


Me: “Oh, sorry! Didn’t mean to almost hit you!”

Nice lady: “Oh, no worries, I did have a question for you though?”

Me: *confused* “Oh?”

Nice lady: “I was wondering how much your dog pools cost? I wanted to buy one but I couldn’t find the price at all.”

Now it’s important to mention that the PetSmart uniform is primarily a dark blue shirt and khaki or black pants, and I was wearing a red tee shirt with black athletic shorts and my beautiful, awful tie die crocs. 


Me: “Oh, I’m so sorry! I don’t work here! I was just buying a bone for my dog!”

Nice lady: *clearly embarrassed* “Oh no, I’m really sorry about that! I saw you putting the toys on the shelf and just figured you were refilling it!”

Me: “Oh, it’s alright! There’s an employee over there though who would be able to help you though!”

She thanked me and apologized again, turning to go to the employee. Her daughter eyed me, and then, turning to follow her mom, said: 

“Mom, I love you, but she clearly doesn’t work here. I don’t think athletic shorts and crocs are part of the uniform.”

As soon as she said that I started laughing, and I walked back to find my friend, who had picked out the perfect heat lamp. I told her what happened, and we still laugh about it occasionally (she laughed when I told her I was going to post it on this sub).

So yeah, it was refreshing not to have some Karen argue that I do work there.

Edit: A lot of people wanted to see pictures of the geckos (they ended up getting two), so I put them on my profile!"

Luckily enough I had a former classmate in a similar position, Valentino. I covered Val's trips to Europe, he covered my wilderness camping, and we billed each other. 

Fast forward two years. Val was still doing his thing, and was now doing it with actual employees! I'd gotten out of the business and taken a 9-5 corporate job.

Thankfully there was only one.

So this happened a long time ago. 10 years maybe. I was 14/15 at the time. My mom and I were at a fabric/craft store perusing. I have been pretty crafty my whole life and already knew how to sew and a bit about different kinds of fabrics. 

I was examining this bolt of fabric wondering if it make a good pillow when a girl maybe 11/12 came up and asked me my advice on the best pj pant fabric. It was for a school home-ech class. Me just being helpful and not thinking much of it took her to the fleece area and just told her to pick her poison. She then tells me ""we arnt allowed to use fleece"". In my head I go ""wtf kind of lame ass pj pants would be made with out fleace??"" But I just shrugged and took her some more sturdy cotton fabrics and left her there to choose what she wanted. 

I finished my shopping w my mom and left. It was about a month later when for some reason that story popped into my mind and I realized the girl must have thought I was an employee! Reason being probably because i was wearing a lanyard around my neck with some keys on it, which the managers at that craft store wore as well. I chuckled a bit at it and wondered if she had ever found fabric to her liking. 

But any how, who the f makes pj pants not out of fleece??? Lame."

Essential backstory: I work in a computer store where the dress code is formal attire (button-down shirt, slacks/khakis, and tie). Me being a *fancy* *boi*, I prefer to add a vest and stylish cap to the outfit as well. This story happened only a couple days ago, so it's still very fresh in my mind.

So it's a normal day at work. After a few hours of the grind I get sent on my break. I've been intermittent fasting so I'm **starving** by this time. What used to be a trip to the wonderful golden arches has changed to the local grocery store (in the same shopping center that my work is located in) once I discovered that they sold delicious, freshly made parfaits.

I arrive, lock on to my target, and capture my treasure. The elation once I have that magical combination of yogurt, granola, and assorted fruits in my hand leaves me spinning. I struggle to find an open cash register. Self checkout has a huge line, and I only have twenty five minutes left on my break. I am desperately searching for someone to take my money. All I want to do is gorge myself on this healthy blend of vitamins and fats. And then I feel it. The dreaded tap on my shoulder that we all know too well.

I turn, and there she is standing before me. The make-up, the resting-bitch-face, and that dreaded haircut. I'm ready for the worst.

""Will you show me where the canned beef gravy is?"" Karen asks me, but in a tone of voice that is more demand than request. ""I left my glasses at home, and can't read the signs.""

Now many times in my life I have been confused for staff at establishments I did not work at. But never had I encountered a Karen before. And certainly not one who had been so angry off the bat. I knew what was happening. I had read the stories, and I was prepared.

I briefly considered telling her that I did not in fact work here. But before I could say anything I remembered that I was here on a mission. A mission with a very strict time frame that if I did not adhere to, I would be at risk for a stern talking to from my manager. I did not want that. I quickly calculated that just conceding and helping this woman would probably take less time than a potential conflict would, especially with how angry she already was.

""Okay, I'm sure I can find it for you."" I responded. I knew the general layout of the grocery store, having bought things from there many a time. I quickly found the canned ingredients section. There on the bottom shelf were several brands and types of gravy, many of which were beef gravy. ""Here they are ma'am.""

""Thank you,"" Karen responds. ""The staff here had no idea what I was talking about.""

And then it hit me. She was never under the impression that I worked there. She just asked me if I could help. She was likely upset because she had been struggling to find something she needed and the staff had been unhelpful. She probably could've gone about it in a more polite fashion, but she may have been desperate. Beef gravy may have been the key ingredient for some delicious homemade mashed potatoes, or a meatloaf, or both!

My preconceived notions about Karens led me to believe that she would be a problem and perhaps ruin my chances to enjoy my sweet, creamy, crunchy delicacy. And I realized that however entitled this woman may or may not have been, I was still an asshole for judging her so harshly without her doing anything really bad to me.

Let this be a lesson to all of you. Even the most Karen-looking person in the world may not be a Karen.

**TL:DR** I was wearing formal attire in a grocery store. A Karen asks me to find something for her. I figure she thinks I work there, but decide to help her anyway. Turns out she knew all along that I didn't work there, and I felt like a dick for judging her so harshly."

I was a manager at PetStupid for about a year and worked at the same store for 11 years. It was an... Interesting experience. Needless to say due to all of this I'm well known in my city and many of my customers came to me directly for everything and anything. Due to the upper management I left. Put in my two weeks and walked out. 

Now I work at Not USPS. Which is a fantastic place so far. I get better pay at the bottom rung than I did as management at PetStupid. I also still get to see alot of my old customers. I still get my chance to help and have a much better job all at the same time.

One of my usuals at Petstupid came into Not USPS the other day. She really is a Nice Lady so I'll call her NL for short. And of course there is Me which is Me.

NL: Omg! Loresdeath! I havent seen you at Petstupid in a while. 

Me: Yep I dont work there anymore. 

NL: oh

She then procedes to tell me about her pups and I ask questions as I do miss the buggers. Then came the part that I have to laugh at now. 

NL: Everything has gone down hill there. I took my babies on up to the grooming salon and a new person shaved them down! Down! All their fur is gone and they are afraid to go back now and they used to love it there. 

Me: Owch, your poor babies? Are they ok now.

NL long tangent on hospital and bills and anpther manager telling her that she needed to bring the vet bills to my old location. 

Me : Thats about right. You need to do that if the groomer hurt your pups. (To be fair most of the time dogs are too matted to do anything other than a shave down, but what do I know, havent been there in over a year now)

NL stares at me : Can you do it for me? 

Me: do what?

NL: the paperwork. If I bring you the paperwork can you fix it.

Me: Sorry, I dont work there anymore. I cant do anything. 

NL pauses for a moment looks around and realizes we arent at PetStupid. Oh. 

Me: Its alright, go there in the morning see if they can help ya. (I honestly dont know who's there anymore. After I left they lost 4 people, a manager stepped down and transfered and as far as I'm aware the turnover rate is insane.)

NL ok. Then she left.

I work on the west coast running my own business as a cyber security consultant. I’m 35 and have been in this business a very long time. I have around 10 employees however the one we just hired is a special case. Very special. She is one of the dumbest smart people I know and her attitude says she graduated with honors from an Ivy League school and that means she owns you. Since I’m the owner of the business I leave most duties to my senior security engineers so she has probably only seen me a few times in the 3 months she’s worked for me.

Cast: K= Karen Me= yours truly MF= manager friend 

I was out shopping for supplies in the office and I decided I was gonna stop by my local Sam’s Club for some lunch. I used to work there when I was in my early 20’s and I was friends with the now manager of the specific store while we were cashiers together. It’s worth mentioning that since I was heading to the office after this I was dressed in my formal business attire. I promise it comes into play later. The Sam’s Club cafe has some of the best food in my opinion for the price that they offer. I finish my food and have a chat with MF. MF leaves to go do manager things and I go to throw away my paper plate that was provided to me for my pizza when I start hearing screaming coming from the cafe counter which isn’t even 10 feet away. I look over to see what is happening.

Karen: “What do you mean you’re out of Frozen Yogurt?! Do you idiots ever keep anything stocked?!” (This was a common thing to happen in the summer time since everyone loves their frozen yogurt) Karen looks at me and rushes over “manager you are going to do something about this! I want that cunt bitch fired right this instant! He was rude and called me a bitch for asking for frozen yogurt!”

Me: “I don’t work-“ she cut me off before I could continue but it was then I started to realize she looked familiar. 

Karen: “I don’t care! You will fire this little pussy ass brat right now or I’m contacting corporate over this!” After that it clicked. She’s my employee. 

Me: “I can’t do anything for you because I don’t work here.” I thought about telling her but I wanted to see where this goes. 

Karen: Jabs her finger into my chest as hard as she can and twists it. “Listen you retard I don’t know who you think I am but I’m leagues smarter than you. The only reason you work here is because you’re a reject who couldn’t finish college.” I almost busted out laughing at that comment but I composed myself.

At this point the actual manager, MF comes running over and asks what wrong. Before I could explain Karen steps in. 

Karen: “he (pointing at me) assaulted me and verbally abused me while refusing to fire this employee (the girl behind the cafe counter who at this point looked visibly horrified) and as his boss you better fire him right this instant! If you don’t I’ll have all of your jobs you insignificant clowns!” Yes she really said that. She called us clowns. How ironic. 

Me: pretty much fed up now I revealed my real identity “Karen I’m *insert name here* the owner of *insert company name here* the consultancy you work for. We just hired you a couple months ago right? (I showed her my badge with title name and picture on it) her face turned whiter than snow 

MF: “I saw her jabbing her finger into you. The cops are already on their way”

I didn’t think it was possible but her face turned even whiter than it was before. She looked like she was about to hurl. Anyway the cops show up look at the security footage and without even asking me anything they handcuff her and take her away. They talk to me and ask me if I wanted to press charges and I said yes (court date pending) and later find out from MF that she yanked the cafe girl by the collar, slapped her, and pushed her back before I had seen her yelling. I asked the cops if I could have a word with her before they drove her away since she’s my employee. They said yes and I walked up to her sitting in the cop car hands cuffed behind her back. She is about to speak but I held my finger up in front of her face 

Me: “for someone who graduated with honors at *insert Ivy League school here* you’re pretty dumb. I was never impressed with your work and now that you’re here I doubt you’ll ever get a job in the security field again. Don’t bother showing up for work anymore.” (I had to add that last part cause I knew she’d be out on bail. Her husband is pretty wealthy too)

Never thought I’d run into a Karen that actually worked for me LMAO

Edit One: As people have pointed out it’s strange that I started writing code 5 months ago but I own a CS firm. You don’t need to know code in CS. It’s not necessary. I started learning code because as my next business venture I’d like to start my own tech company so I started learning. Contrary to what people think owning a CS firm is costly and time consuming so me talking about “buying something with my next paycheck” isn’t exactly far off. I just spend my money wisely and not on myself very often."

So about six months ago, I was out shopping with my mom, when I saw a box of garlic dip. I told my mom that I wanted some, and she saw that there was no advertisment showing a discount. She saw some dude holding a basket full of yogurt, and decided that he worked there.

My Mom: Is there any deal on buying 2 boxes of garlic dip?

Random dude: Ma'am, I don't work here.

My mom: OK, sorry

We then found a store employee who told us that there was no discount.

TL;DR: My mom was buying garlic dip, and saw a man who loved yogurt. She thought he was an employee, and asked him if there was any discount."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cwfarf/i_just_like_steampunk/,"I just like steampunk Sorry to say, but this isn't one of those epic stories where a Karen yells at me for twenty minutes until the manager drags her out of the store. But this is a story of me being mistaken for an employee.  
This story takes place at a Christmas fair, a few years ago. there were stands everywhere, selling pretty much what you'd expect to be sold at a fair, and as far as I could remember, none of the employees had any kind of uniform. one of the stands was selling hats. most of the hats were normal, but there was a rack with some unique hats.  
two of those hats where clearly steampunk. one was a gray tophat, covered gears, dials, gauges, chains, and even bottle corks. the other was a red top hat with some sort of fin or scale, and an eye that I assumed was a dragon's eye. and these hats weren't like the cheap kind you'd get at a costume store. the gray one especially, had some weight to it.  
now, some context about me. I'm a giant geek, and when given an opportunity to talk about something I have an in, I'll just go on and on, until I run out of things to say or the subject changes.

so, given the amount of detail I gave about the hats, and the fact I love talking about my interests, I think you guess what eventually happens.

eventually, a man starts eyeing the rack. I don't remember what prompted me, if it was him asking about it, or me just wanting to educate him. the end result was, I started to describe the steampunk hats in great detail.

I must have seen like an amazing saleswoman, because he said something like ""how long have you worked here?"" or ""what's your info?"" something that translated to ""I'd like to do business with you"". before I could realize what he was asking, my mother stepped in saying ""she doesn't work here"". He didn't get mad, and we all had a laugh.

and in case anyone's wondering? I did get a hat, not one of the steampunk hats, it's a 1920's paperboy hat."

Also could not resign. So this was 5 years ago.

Sadly my company had no clue what I was talking about when I asked them. I call the bank and they tell me it's from another company. I actually was on an interview at the company but turned down their offer. So I call the company:

Me: I get a weekly salary from you, the problem is I don't work here and you need to reclaim the money.

Receptionist: when did you quit your job? I can't find your resignation letter.

Me: Never, I have never worked for you.

R: ......but... You work here. I can't take the salary back, our salary is correct. You have a perfect score. You did 40 hours a week last month.

Me: great, I also did the same hours att (My company) so I'm a busy person then. Seriously I don't work here, some lazy manager must be sending you perfect scores since there is nothing else to report.

R: Do you want to leave your one month notice?

Me: No, please just remove me, I don't work for you.

R: (a little frustrated) I can't, you need to fill out a resignation letter, give it to your manager and work your last month, or else you cold get fined for not following the contract.

Me: I absolutely refuse. But I wan't you to find the paperwork i signed when I started my employment and read it out loud to me.

R: .... I can't find it. It's not here. When did you sign it?

Me: I didn't.

R: I don't get it.... You... Don't work here and did not sign anything? .... I'll call you back.

A couple of hours later she calls me back, ranting about how it's a criminal act to keep the money and that I need to return it att once. Well...I tried?"

Grandma Hellen: “Could get you get “item” for me?” She pointed at an item at the top shelf far from her reach.

Chris (being a gentleman): “Sure ma’am.” He grabbed the item puts in her cart.

Grandma Hellen: *sign* “Could you please help me get some other items? I thought I could do some shopping by myself but l’m already tired.”

Chris, having nothing else to do that day, decided why not and helped Grandma Hellen out. Chris talked to Grandma Hellen and found out that she listened firsthand Martin Luther King’s “I Have Dream” speech and witnessed other historic events. Over all, Chris had good time with Grandma Hellen. After almost an hour, they finally arrived at a checkout.

Grandma Hellen (at the cashier): “You should talk to your manager about giving this young man. He was so helpful to me today.”

Chris: “Ma’am, I don’t actually work here.”

Cashier: “He’s right, ma’am.”

Grandma Hellen had an embarrassed expression and began apologizing profusely. After Chris calmed her down, he explained that he had nothing else to do that day and that he enjoyed listening to her talk. After much convincing, Grandma Hellen ended paying for Chris’ stuff, and Chris ended up having a more interesting day than expected.

IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cw0h8x/sometimes_a_handlebar_mustache_can_be_part_of_the/,"Sometimes a handlebar mustache can be part of the uniform. First off, this is a feel good story. So I’ve been subscribed to this sub for a while but never really participated. I showed my wife this sub the other day and she insisted I share my (our) own story. Funnily enough, 90% of my stories happened at the same major retailer. I’ve never had a horror story encounter so I count myself lucky. This happened maybe 3-4 years ago, back when my wife and I were dating. The players in this are: Me - my wife (then girlfriend) - cute little old lady - and two confused employees. Now as to where it happened, I won’t tell you but it’s known for its URBAN appeal and the OUTFITS that are typically on trend and stylish ( also remarkably pricey )

The reason why I want to tell this story in particular is because:

a) it was the most recent occurrence 
b) my wife got roped into it
c) we both gotta good laugh out of it
d) I saw my freaking twin

Anyway, this was either 2015 or 2016. My wife (then girlfriend) and I were checking out the shops in one of the hip neighborhoods when we decided to walk into my wife’s favorite store. I like shopping there too because the clearance sections are always great. Anyway I’m standing near the entrance checking out the men’s hats looking for a wide brim fedora (I was super into fedodos at the time - don’t judge me) when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and lo and behold, the sweetest little old lady is there in typical grandma wear - I’m 98% sure her sweater had kittens on it. Before I can get a word out, she says something along the lines of, “Excuse me young man, I’m looking for a gift for my grandson, he’s entering the 9th-12th grade and I wanted to buy him some nice clothes for his birthday so he can look extra handsome for the girls.” Now in any other store I’d have pulled the “I don’t work here lady” card, but because of how polite she was I played along. 

If you were to describe my style of dress it would start with “hip” and end with “ster”. I kinda committed to the look in my early 20s and never really got away from it. Given the store I was in, the khaki joggers, camo button down, brown fedora, and obnoxious handlebar mustache (we have photos from dinner that night which is why I remember) I couldn’t really blame the lady for assuming I worked at Hipsters R Us. So I did the only logical thing I could think of, I took her to the Men’s side and helped her pick out some outfits.

Now this entire time my wife was near the front of the store checking out the camera stuff/knick knacks they sell to the Instagram obsessed. When I wasn’t in the clearance section she went over to the guys section to see... something confusing. At this point, I saw my wife poke her head out of the clearance section to see a little old lady holding several shirts up to my chest, “Oh so-and-so would look good in this don’t you think?” At this point I had been following the lady around for ten to fifteen minutes. I had chosen three different outfits that she liked and she was looking for magic number four. I’m over here too deep at this point to back out now, so I just looked at my wife pleading with my eyes for her to rescue me. My wife decided at that moment that she wanted in on the fun so she just sauntered up and in her best customer service voice said, “Good afternoon ma’am, I hope you’re enjoying your time at _______. If you need any further assistance please don’t hesitate to ask HiImJimmothy, he’s one of our best employees.” 

I chose a winner folks. It’s at this point the lady decides the green shirt was better than the blue shirt so I walk her over to the counter. I leave her and say, “If you need anything else, don’t hesitate to ask” My wife joins me at the front and we just watch her checkout. The lady at the registers does the typical, “ Hello/how was your experience/did you have any trouble finding anything” bit and we overhear the following conversation:

“That young man in the green shirt was honestly the most helpful young man I’ve ever encountered. He helped me pick out all these outfits for my grandson and had a smile the entire time”

“Oh do you mean ______?”

And I shit you not, my freaking doppelgänger walks out from one of the side doors, same colored pants, different patterned camo shirt but camo shirt nonetheless, and a brown fedora. And the piece de resistance - he had a glorious handlebar mustache. One problem though, I’m Filipino and the dude was white. The old lady shakes her head and points at me, “No him over there.” At this point I just start waving at them and tell them I’m gonna take my break, call me if they need anything. And that’s the story of the day I met my white twin and the shortest job I ever had."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cw2jqx/youre_way_too_young_to_own_a_1000_phone_youve/,"You're way too young to own a $1000 phone you've clearly stole it! Don't know this is actually related or not. But I think she's definitely a Aunty Karen.
So here's some what about me.

I'm 17. I come from a little bit more financially stable family than the rest of the Island. I graduated 16 from my school and kept surfing through jobs for 4 months and ended up finally settling in my brother's restaurant. Untill further studies of course. I'm from Maldives, where the people are keen to medal into stuff they have nothing to do with. It's really irritating and fucking frustrating at times, but the beautiful beaches and awesome seas make up for the assholes in the Maldives. But then again it's often the old farts who are like this, non of the new generation guys are like this. They are often very polite. So anyone who's saying that millennials are ruder than old farts. F off. Ps. I'm not very good in English and apologies for any inconvenience. Plus it's a really long read so brace yourself.

So this is the back story.

It was my off day from the restaurant. So I thought I'd go to a neighboring Island just to unwind and take the stress off from working 6 days a week on 8 hour shifts. It can be really tiring sometimes. I had a Samsung galaxy s10 plus that I bought from my own money. With help with my brothers of course. Note that in Maldives it's not the often that young teen under 18 is in a job with a top of the line phone. Or so this women thought. It was around 1pm and I thought I'd have some lunch. That island was well known for the fried chicken rice. And believe me it was really good. So there I was sitting in the chair of the restaurant waiting for my oder playing not so awesome game on my phone. And in come this big fat aunty and her equally fat kid. Which also happens to be a tech geek. And came near to the place I was sitting. Also some stuff maybe lost in translation. Fat aunty is FA. ,her fat kid is FK, the restaurant cashier is RC. And I'm obviously me.

FA.= Hey kid give me this chair
Me= Yeah sure take it.

Not wanting to make contact with other people I didn't even think of it that much. Few minutes later. The fat kid comes marching to me and what came out of that spoiled brat's mouth makes me question the innocence of Little kids.

FK. Hey! Give me that phone. I'm bored I want to play that game!
Me= What?! 

I was like whaaa? How is this kid? What is this kid? I replied very very politely.

Me= Can't do that little guy. Tell your mom to give her phone to play.

I smiled at the end thinking that he might get sad and 
disappointed too much. And this kid. OMG what happened next....

FK= NO GIVE ME THE PHONE. I WANT IT NOW NOW!!

At this point this kid is crying his balls out like the spoiled brat he is. The whole restaurant is looking at me and my anxiety was acting up. I have really bad anxiety by the way. Then after a while the mom of this kid fat aunty approaches. I thought thank god. She'll make things better. Ohh. How wrong was I. The conversation follows.

FA.= Hey! why are you making my kid cry. Look at him. What did you do.
Me= I didn't do anything, he asked me if i could give him my phone but i said no then he just burst into tears....
FA.= Well give it to him! It's not like it's yours anyways. Now GIVE IT!

I was scared out of my life at this point. My anxiety was acting up and i didn't feel so well at the time.

Me= I..I..this is my phone ...
FK= No! Mum!! there's no way he can afford that. Thats brand new and it's the best phone of Samsung.
FA= YEAH! My son knows his phones. You probably stole that didn't you. 
WHO DID YOU STOLE IT FROM?

At this point I'm petrified. I don't do good with people yelling at me. 
I'm really a shy person and really avoid confronting people. Specially when they are attacking me. And next the unthinkable happens. This big fat whore reaches to my hand and tries to get my phone away from me. I curled up as she was approaching me. Then comes to the rescue 
RC. Honestly if he'd were any late I'd be bursting into tears. 

RC= Hey lady. Why are you harassing this boy? 
FA= ME! THIS THIFE STOLE A EXPENSIVE PHONE AND IS HARASSING MY SON! AND YOU SAY IM HARASSING HIM?

The RC clearly saw that I was just minding my own business and this fat bitch came to me, not the other way around.

RC= No. I saw your son come up to him and say something and he smiled then your son started crying.
FA= Even if that's the case. HE HAS STOLEN THAT PHONE AREN'T YOU GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

This bitch was shouting so hard that I started to actually have a panic attack. I'm not good with people shouting as i said before. 

RC= Ok calm down first. Did you see him steal this phone? Or is it yours?
FA= No. But I'm sure he stole it! There's no way he could afford that kind of phone so young. My son says it's a brand new phone and that its top of the line. Do something about it!
RC= ok. I don't know if your mentally retarded or just acting stupid but that is just stupidity at the highest.

FA was furious for being called a retard and started SCREAMING at the RC. 

FA= YOU MOTHERFUCKER. DID YOU JUST CALL ME A RETARD?

And yada yada. I don't recall what happened next quite frankly. I was curled up to a ball and had my hands on my ears. The next thing I knew they were taken out of the restaurant all the while FK. Was whining like a dog. 
RC Asked me if I was ok and if i needed a glass of water.
I just shrugged it off and tried to be stay calm as much as I can. The RC gave me a bottle of water and said the meal was on the house. and was sorry for what happened. She and I are now friends and often go out together when I'm in her Island. Apparently the FA. Is known for making trouble around the island and everyone hates her and her spoiled brat.


I actually don't know what worse, encouraging your son's rude behaviour or swearing so much Infront of your son ..

Determined to NOT be the one asking a customer for help, I have gotten into the habit of approaching suspected staff like this, ""excuse, do you work here?""   So far, I am batting 1000 and everyone I ask has worked at the stores.

Yesterday, I made a trip to Mart of Walls and was looking to get some Go-Jo soap for my mechanically inclined son.  I was in the automotive section and saw a young lady working on a display and approached her.  She looked up and me I started with, ""excuse me..."" and I paused....something was off......then I finished with, ""you do work here"".

She smiled and looked down at her vest and said ""yes I do, how can I help you?""

I chucked at myself and explained to her about all the IDWHL stories I've read and that I had started to ask her if she worked at the store.  I had a brain fart because she obviously worked there, and my question would have been redundant.    She laughed and took me to the back wall where they kept the hand cleaners.

So training myself to avoid the IDWHL curse has led me to asking stupid questions, almost.

I wonder if Wally Mart workers have a sub for people who ask employees wearing a vest and company ID ""Do you work here""?"

So,this story happened to me a few days ago . A little info of myself , I'm a 14 year old boy and I'm very tall for my age (1.9ish meters) . I was doing some shopping for a hangout with my friends at one of their houses , I was wearing a black shirt and some grey shorts . The employees there wore grey shirts , white shorts and a black apron (this was a bakery ) .

I was just searching for a pastry for my friend then a lady (Karen style) approached me and said: ""EXCUSE ME?!?"" I looked back startled to see her face,covered in makeup,i said : ""Yes?"" Annoyed,she said : "" I WAS FOLLOWING YOU FOR THE PAST 10 MINUTES! WHY DIDN'T U STOP AND HELP ME "" (I was in that store for 4 minutes or so) ""Uhm..Sorry I don't work here,I'm 14 ""

She was pissed : ""STOP LYING! YOU'RE NOT 14! YOU'RE SO TALL, I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER !""

Some employees heard the commotion and came to see what's happening : ""Excuse me ma'am ,what seems to be the problem here?""

The lady grabbed my arm (and dug her nails in my skin) : ""THIS IDIOT IS LYING AND DOESN'T WANT TO HELP ME,I WANT TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER THIS INSTANT!""

The employee said in a calm tone : ""Please ma'am,calm down . This man doesn't work here""

I tried to free my arm from her claws and i succeeded but one of her cheap nails broke, ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE: ""OH MY LORD! SOMEONE CALL THE POLICE , THIS PERVERT TRIED TO RAPE ME!!!""

The employee called the manager, a woman dressed in a formal outfit came and asked : ""Why did you call me \[Employee's name\]?""

""This Lady accused this man of rape , just because she broke a nail""""HOW DARE YOU COVER UP YOUR COLLEAGUE ?!? I WANT THEM BOTH FIRED IMMEDIATELY, AND THIS MAN IN PRISON!""

The manager clearly angry: "" Ma'am i have contacted the authorities,but this man is not the one who will be going with them,you will""

The woman realised her plan wasn't working and ran to the door , but to her misfortune the police was already there.

She started crying and said : "" These people tried to rape me!""

The police talked for a bit with the manager and then they went to the backdoor (where the CCTV tapes were i assume)

(The angry woman was held by an officer just so she would't leave)

After about 10 minutes the police came to me and said: ""Would you like to press charges ?""

I politely declined saying that I'm only 14 (i was much taller than the officer talking to me) and i just want to go to my hangout

They let me go but the woman still was arrested for lying to the police or something like that.

Sorry for the long story but i hope you guys just walk away if a Karen tries to speak to you :)"

For Context I am 5'9 and weigh in at around 205. So when the punch landed I really didn't feel it. However I assume an employee saw the fight and called the cops. Cause next thing I know like 3 cops showed up. One pulled me to the side and the other pull the couple to the side. After I explained what happened in my own words. The other cop walks over and asked did I assault that lady. I started laughing and said no. From what I can figure cause the cops didn't say anything else, big Bertha said I hit her. So the cops pulled the footage, side note when the cop said they are pulling the footage the couple tried to jet.. Anyways they ended up arresting her (I didn't hear all the charges) 

So that happen about last Saturday.. And that's the 2 Karen Stories I have.."

Cast Me=me  eb= entitled bitch  SO= sweet old lady

I live near by a walmart, the uniform is a blue polo and black pants. Im wearing black pants and a black shirt. Im short 5'2 (im a woman so no big deal)and browsing in the store and see paper towels on sale but they where in the top shelf. (Ugh just my luck.)so I try to look for an employee but no luck. But.. I see a cart that employees usually get to collect merchandise from the store to put back (I know this because said cart usually has a big advert taped on it) and in the cart I see a broom, getting an idea to use the broom to get the papel towers, so I take it and return to the paper towels after getting a few for me, a sweet old lady comes up 

SO: hello! Can you help me to get one? -

-Me: Yea sure! Using the broom tople another for her. She thanks me and leaves. Im about to turn around and leave when I hear it

- Hey! Eb-bottled blonde with the haircut(why always the damn haircut?) with a phone in her ear. 

EB= hey you! (Snapping her fingers)Arent you going to get one for me?Im waiting here! 

Me: what? 

Eb= talking like im stupid or slow GIVEEE. MEEE. PAAAAPER. TOOOWELS! 

Me: I dont work here.

 Eb= Ignoring me and going back to her phone -fuking lazy employees!! You have to be 100 yrs old to get any help, They are useless. Hold hunny, (then back to me) I dont have time for this! give me the fucking broom. Ill get it my self!. 

I dont take kindly to rude people, so my petty and rude side came up. 

Me= 1st Fuck off, 2nd witches are not allowed to fly inside the store!  

Shoving the broom in my cart I left. She gasped and started to rant to her phone. 

Eb= Did you hear that! O-M-G! ( literally she said o.m.g, lol)And told whoever she was talking to she was going to find a manager and will get my ass fired by the end of the day. 

I laughed and continued with my shopping, this store is big so you can get out of view fairly quickly, 20 min later or so. I went to registers. I saw karen she was chewing one of the managers and stomping her feet at Customer Service desk but I did not got any closer where they could see me, payed for my stuff, and while exiting the store, I said out loud BYEEE waiving at her and then flipping her off when she looked at me. Her face was priceless."

Went to a hardware store that has a large gardening section to pick up several potted plants, as gifts. The employees at this store wear red polos and jeans, and I was wearing a similar ensemble, save for the store logo. 

I had been shifting around some large cyclamens, looking for healthy ones when I was approached by an assistant.

Assistant: Hey, I just put those in there

Me: Oh, sorry! I was just looking through them. They're so pretty! 

At this point, I've turned around and she has realised I don't work here.

Assistant: Oh! No problem. Sorry, thought you were a staff member re-organising it.

Me: Aww, yeah, bad day to wear this outfit I guess.

I go up to the front with 12 cyclamen gifts. The assistant at the check-out and I chat and make jokes about the amount of plants I'm picking up, and she agrees it's a good deal. When ringing me up, I realise she has mistaken me as an employee.

Assistant: So you've finished for the day, huh? Hold up, I need to put the discount on.

Me: Finished for the day?

Assistant: Yeah. Hey, do you know how to do the discount? Sarah showed me but I keep forgetting

Me: Ohh. Sorry, I don't work here, so there's no need for a discount! 

Assistant: Aww damn, that's cool. This is actually my first week here so I thought I made a work friend, dang

Me: Omg, I'm so sorry

Please visit Storytime's YouTube channel to hear a fantastic reading of this story: youtu.be/WUxOlq8jRW0


A little bit of background: I had been working at a large-ish company for a little over a year. This company offers an ""online service"" to anyone willing to pay. I started off in the Customer Service department that takes calls from non-military / non-business customers. While my department didn't deal with any sensitive information, my call center was still located in the company's secure facility, located in the middle of nowhere. The daily commute was long, but there was never any traffic so it wasn't bad. The nearest town is about 30 minutes away along the highway, which is where I lived. While its not a huge town, it is big enough to contain a Balmart.

&#x200B;

At the time of this story I had just moved over to the Information Security (IS) department, in an entry level position. I ended up taking a minor pay cut, but that is more than made up by the gas I save by working from home. Unfortunately I had to wear a uniform any days I worked from the office, which was twice a week. This uniform was designed to look very similar to our physical security staff, with some noticeable differences; like the words ""Information Security"" plastered on the back, with my name stenciled on the front.

&#x200B;

One day after driving home from work I decide to stop by Balmart to get something for dinner. While looking at some rice I hear a screech from the other  aisle, along with some incoherent yelling. Out of curiosity I wander over. This was a mistake, as the moment I laid eyes on the ""I want to speak to your manager"" haircut, the woman it's attached to turned and started stomping in my direction, while making direct eye contact with me. She shall be known as **Karen**. I didn't have long but I managed to size up the situation: Balmart store employee (who shall be known as ""**Store Employee**"") staring after **Karen**, and **me**. **Karen's** face contorted in anger. The last thing I notice before **the** yelling  was the ID around her neck. It was a very unique ID, which contained her name, a photo, a unique number only assigned to her, and a dumb looking anti-photocopy holographic security-animal thing. I had an almost identical one in my pocket, only with my own information.

&#x200B;

**Karen**, with dilated pupils, slightly shaky hands, and a punctuation-less vocabulary attempted to explain to me that **Store Employee** was extremely rude, threatened to kill/harm her, and refused to get her cigarettes. **Karen** further explained, at 90 dB, that she wants **Store Employee** fired and arrested for assault. Without missing a beat she then starts demanding that I pay attention to her. I was in fact looking around us, first trying to see if we were in line of sight of the store cameras, trying to see if there were any other witnesses down the  aisle, and trying to keep track of **Store Employee's** movements.

&#x200B;

I take a deep breath, putting both hands in to my pockets. I then stare down at **Karen** with as much anger as I can muster, which causes a moment respite in the avalanche of obscenities, allegations, and demands that had been offending the ear.  With one hand I grab my phone in my pocket, double tab the power button, very carefully swiping across the screen, then I press the volume down button. Those who are familiar with Android will recognize that I just started recording a video on my phone. (I really need to make a hotkey that takes less effort) After I hear my phone beep I take both hands out of my pocket, leaving the phone behind. With a placating gesture I beg forgiveness of **Karen** and ask her to calmly repeat what she said to me. **Karen**, as if she is wading through a sea of stupidity, sighs deeply and regales her tale of woe, this time with minor differences to details, such as the **Store Employee** really assaulting **Karen**, instead of just threatening to do so. At this point the **Store Employee** leaves the  aisle, and I lose track of her. The following conversation ensures:

&#x200B;

* **Karen**: Well? what are you going to do about it?
* **Me**: I apologize however I am not going to do anything about this. I highly recommend you go talk to the store manager.
* **Karen**: What?!!?! I demand you arrest \[**Store Employee**\] now! I want to press charges!
* **Me**: Unfortunately I am not law enforcement, and cannot arrest anyone. I still recommend you speak to this stores manager, or if you are so inclined speak to the security out front.
* **Karen**: Fine, go get your manager and bring him to me.
* **Me**: Ma'am, I feel there has been some miscommunication here. I'm starting to get the feeling that you think I work here in some capacity. I'd like to take this moment to inform you that I do not. I work at the same company you do. Now please...
* **Karen**: Bull\*\*\*t. I recognize your uniform! You're security, it says so right there \*points at the word Security, just above my name on the front of my shirt\*. Just get me the manager and I'll have your job too!
* **Me**: Ma'am, may I please have your name, and your ID number. (At this point I have already memorized the ID number, only 6 digits long, and her first name, however her last name was obscenely long, likely a foreign name)

Karen then looks confused. She takes her ID and stuffs it in to her blouse, hiding it from my view. She starts to splutter in confusion and rage, when I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around to see an older gentleman with **Store Employee** behind him. A quick glance tells me this is the store manager, who shall be known as **Store Manager**.

* **Store Manager**: What is going on here?
* **Karen**: I want both of them fired and arrested! They assaulted me!....

Karen then goes on an incomprehensible tirade, suggesting that I and **Store Employee** had teamed up on her and did \[something, wasn't clear\] to her. While she was yelling I could see the **Store Manager** wanting to interject. I put my hand up to stop him, and made a motion indicating we should let **Karen** finish. When there was a noticeable gap in the auditory assault I took the opportunity to ask the **Store Manager** to speak with him and **Store Employee** alone.

&#x200B;

* \*\*Store Manager: \*\*\*Nods\* (turns to address Karen) I am very sorry that you had such a horrible experience! I assure you we will sort this all out immediately. Everyone, please follow me to my office.
* **Karen**: About time! I demand compensation! I want them arrested! (and appears to start another tirade)
* **Store Manager**: (now walking away): Please follow me.

&#x200B;

We follow **Store Manager**, with **Karen** making comments about how shes going to enjoy this, something about court, being able to retire, ect. Once we reach the **Store Manager**'s office he asked that **Karen** wait outside while he interviews me and **Store Employee**. We are quickly ushered in to his office, and the door closes just as **Karen** starts to object. I immediately apologize to **Store Manager**, explain that **Karen** works at the same company I do, and I fully plan on reporting her to our **HR** for this. (Although what she does off the clock is her business, I personally think I could make a case against her for verbally assaulting me.) I ask the **Store Manager** for details around the event, so I may explain in detail to **HR**. It turns out the **Store Employee** was returning something to the shelf, when **Karen** cornered her and started demanding a specific brand of cigarettes. This brand was no longer being sold, and the store constantly receives complains about this, the **Store Manager** explained to me.  Apparently when this was explained to **Karen** she blew up at **Store Employee**. I suspected this was the screech I heard. The **Store Manager**, in turn asks me about my conversation with **Karen**. I pull out my phone, stop the recording and play back the video for them to hear. I asked the **Store Manager** if he would be willing to send me a copy of the surveillance footage of the incident. In a joking tone the **Store Manager** replies ""I'll share if you do"". I have no issue with this, and we exchange contact information.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately on my way out **Karen** saw fit to harass me one final time, screeching about how the cops are on their way, and that I am going to be arrested, and so on. I just ignored her and continued to walk out. I figured the **Store Manager** could handle that from there.

&#x200B;

The next day I look up Karen in our databases. She is a call center employee, doing similar work as I did, except she works on military contracts only. On average she speaks to about 50 customers a day. I type up my interaction with Karen and shoot it on over to her manager, who shall be known as **Manager.** I then send a similar email to **HR**, only this time I included a copy of my own recording (edited to only be audio).

&#x200B;

While waiting for a response I received an email from **Store Manager**, he provided me a copy of the surveillance videos, however they did not contain audio. **Store Manager** then outlined events that took place after my departure: It turns out **Karen** called the cops while waiting outside **Store Manager**'s office. When they arrived they spoke to **Karen** outside, then spoke to **Store Manager**. They didn't really explain to the **Store Manager,** as he was quick to show them the surveillance video, which appears to have answered all of their questions. The cops then left the store. The Store Manager did not see **Karen** again that night, so he was unsure what happened. I responded back with a copy of my own video, and a thank you note. I also mentioned that I forgot to get **Store Employee**'s name, and asked if I could get it.

&#x200B;

Once the **Store Manager** responded (and included a written account from **Store Employee**) I took the **Store Employee**'s information and look her up our many customer databases. Although she once was a customer, she has not been one for a while. **Karen**'s **Manager** responds to my email explaining that this does not surprise her. Karen has been one of those ""trouble"" employees for a little while now. Multiple write-ups, documented recordings where Karen starts yelling at customers unprovoked, ect. The most recent recent was only a few days prior.

&#x200B;

I send an updated email to **HR** with my new findings. Given my role, and the scope of my position I can no longer do any more digging in to **Karen** without approval from **HR**. I voice my concerns to **HR** about the potential risk Karen poses to the company. I don't hear back from **HR** until the end of the work day, where I am inviting to a meeting with them.

&#x200B;

That day I am working from home, so I have to join the meeting remotely. We have three conference rooms with large TVs and cameras, one of which was reserved by HR for this incident. I join the meeting, knowing my face is plastered all over the wall every time I speak. The meeting starts off with **HR** clarifying some facts with me and **Manager**, we go over video from **Store Manager**, my own recordings, and review the written statement from **Store Employee**. **HR** determines that Karen's employment needs to be terminated. **Manager** is in agreement, given **Karen**'s history, however **Manager** would like additional time to find a replacement. **HR** and **Manager** asks for my input, for which I have none. This is not within scope of my job, however I feel I need to stay involved to cut off her access at a moment's notice to limit retaliation opportunities. **Manager** and **HR** go back and forth for a while, until the meeting is almost over, when **Manager** agrees to let **Karen** go immediately.

&#x200B;

Karen is then called in to the meeting. She is silent and meek as she takes her seat. Karen is slightly startled at the sudden movement of the cameras as they track her moment. (These cameras are designed to auto-track movement and sounds, so this is not abnormal, but I doubt Karen has used these rooms that much, so she might not have expected that). **Manager** asks if she knows why she is here. Karen busts in to tears exclaiming that ""that guy"" was so rude and obscene to her, that she just couldn't take it any more and that is why she yelled at him. She apologizes and is willing to take whatever **HR** mandated training is required, she is willing to learn from her mistakes. I am confused, and I see the same thing on **HR's** face, however the **Manager** appears to understand. The **Manager** asks some questions, and it becomes clear that **Karen** is talking about a bad phone call she received earlier that morning. I am not in any hurry so sit back and let the **Manager** run the show. **Manager** plays the phone recording for us where we clearly hear a very rude customer cussing out **Karen**. **Karen** is immediately rude back. Call ends with **Karen** hanging up on the customer saying ""Get a life!"" **Karen** is still remorseful and extremely meek. **Manager** thanks **Karen** for her honestly, however that is not the point of this meeting. The Manager then explains that due to her anger issues and a history of not improving, she is sorry to have to let **Karen** go. That was my sign to turn off all of her access. The good news is that Karen didn't have access to a whole lot, so kicking her out of our systems was quick and easy. While I was working on this **HR** and **Manager** explain the severance package, and so on.

&#x200B;

Then, something happened to grab Karen's attention. I am honestly not sure what happened, but I think I un-muted my microphone or something, because all of a sudden Karen was staring up at the TVs, where I can only assume she saw my smug face. I hear a halt in conversation and I turn to look at the screen, which is when I see Karen staring at me. At first she looked confused, then that quickly turned in to a smirk which was rapidly replaced with a look of horror. She then stood up, pointing at the screen and demanded that I be arrested. Claiming that I assaulted her at Balmart the night prior, and it wasn't her fault. Breaking down in to tears she starts repeating ""Keep him away from me!!"". I speak up and ask if **HR** or **Manager** would like me to call physical security. **HR** thanks me, asks me to do just that, but **HR** would also like that I leave the meeting now, which I do.

&#x200B;

The next day I see her termination paperwork come through. My department helps with all of these requests, doing a quick audit on recent activity to make sure there was nothing harmful done to the company. Unfortunately I am not privy to what happened after I left the meeting, so I don't have any juicy ending here. Just that Karen lost her job, and 'might' have been escorted to the gates of the complex.

&#x200B;

A side note: the small town nearby survives only on employees at my office. There are no other large employers near by. I am not sure if Karen lives in this town or not, but if she does her only hope for employment is at Balmart, or to move to a different town.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr: Karen demands I arrest a Balmart employee for not doing her job. Instead we have a meeting with Karen, her manager, and HR. Karen is then fired.**"

Coming from school or work, I usually go to the gym if possible. Monday to Friday, I try to find the time to workout since I gained a lot of weight during the summer. Now, I this gym I go to was just a local gym. We have a small community in that gym that knows each other very well. Now, as a regular, I pretty much recognize everyone, and everyone already recognized me. Now, during a Friday, I see a new face. She seemed like a typical soccer mom who just came from dropping off her kids to school. Now, before anything else happens, mind you, I was wearing something completely different from all the employees. They had this blue shirt with brown workout shorts, kind of like those Honda helper guys. I was wearing a dark grey shirt and black sweatpants, which was completely different from the employees. Now, during this Friday, we had these barbell areas that were hooked up to safety lines. I don't know exactly what they're called, but it's those huge mechanical things that held barbells and several weights. Now, the safety lines for these machines needed to be replaced, so yellow caution tape surrounded these things. I was just by it, at a different machine. Karen walks in the gym, checks in, and heads to the barbell areas.  


K = Karen; Me = Me; B = Boss (Manager of the gym)  


Me: \*Minding my business, just working out.\*  
K: \*Waves at me\*  
Me: \*Takes out my earbuds\* Yeah? What's up?  
K: Hey, can you help me out?  
Me: Uh, sure. I'm guessing you're new here.  
K: Actually, yeah. I wanted to use those barbells, and I was wondering if it was okay to take those off.  
(During this time, she was still gentle. Heavens, I wish she was still gentle after this.)  
Me: Sorry, ma'am. The gym's replacing the safety lines for the barbells, and it's not my job to take off the tape.  
K: Why's that? \*Now in a sassy tone\*  
Me: Because I don't work here.  
K: I mean, you're working out close to that station, so I know you're lying.  
Me: Ma'am, I look completely different from the employees. I'm wearing gr-  
K: \*Cutting me off\* Save it. Just take off those tapes right now.  
Me: Excuse me?  
(Now, I was already having a shitty day, so I wasn't gonna take her sassy attitude and just keep silent.)  
Me: Lady, I told you already. It's no-  
K: JUST DO IT! \*She screams\*  
(Now, at this point, the whole gym probably heard her by now. Again, I wasn't gonna have her bitchy attitude at this point.)  
Me: How many times do I have to tell you? I DON'T WORK HERE! And even if I did, I wouldn't be allowed to just take off the tape and let you have a go at it! Do you want to fucking die while using those barbells? Huh? I have been nice to you, and I have not talked back to you until now, and yet you chose to push me to my limits! I've had a pretty shitty week, and this is the only time I get to relieve my stress. You showing up in front of me and yelling at me just made my day a whole lot worse. I suggest you fucking leave my vision before I knock you out cold with my bare fist.  
(Usually, people just end up leaving me alone at this point. Oh boy, not this lady.)  
K: I KNOW YOU WORK HERE! I'm going to call your manager right now and get you fired!  
Me: (I have a problem with anger management, and at this point, I just let out a loud scream. That's when the manager finally comes to me.)  
B: Hazel, calm down. I don't want you to get tantrums here and now.  
Me: \*Tries to calm down\* Thanks, chief, but I've been talking to a damn idiot this whole time.  
B: \*Looks at the lady\* Ma'am, I suggest you step out of the gym.  
K: What? Why? I'm a member here!  
B: Look, my friend Hazel here doesn't give a damn if it's a man or a woman he's talking to. He'll actually sock you if you stay any longer here. Also, since you've caused quite a commotion, I'm revoking your membership.  
K: What?! You can't do that! Who are you anyway?!  
B: The manager. Now, please leave.  
K: Damnit! I'm gonna get you fired too! Who's your supervisor? I'll get both of you fired right now!  
B: Hazel, step out right now. I'll call you when things calm down.  


So, after that, I walk out the gym. A couple moments later, the cop pulls up to the gym. Apparently, I heard that she got arrested for disrupting the peace or something. Whatever it was, I'm just glad she's gone, and I don't have to give this lady a black eye."

Orientation has sorta arrived as the kids here for athletics or other early programs started showing up this past week. I’m working tons of events as a result and will be for the next two weeks.

There was a breakfast thing I had to do this AM, no big. What I forgot was my lanyard. Sometimes I forget about them after a bit. It has a big university logo, my department name and an orientation logo that admittedly looks like a sick amoeba.

So I swung through the local big box home improvement place on my way home as I needed some caulk. While I’m seeking it, a wild Chad appears. You know him. He’s a frat boy during work week who is offended to be sent on an errand to the big box home improvement place to start.

He saw my lanyard and assumed I worked there. Apparently he needed to fix a hole in the wall some brother punched last year because... whatever. I don’t care. I don’t work there. I tell him to seek somebody who does, and he gets in my face and tells me he doesn’t care where I work, do I know how to help him?

Can I fix a drywall hole? Yes. Do I send him on his way with a stack of things that seem like they might help if you know nothing but will not? Also yes. Have fun, Chad. You are all set to re-grout a tile shower. Next time try an employee."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cvhoxy/where_is_the_bus_driver/,"Where is the bus driver?! I was waiting for the bus earlier today (yay car troubles)  it was not peak travel time or anything, so I was the only person waiting at this particular stop. I was a little early, but I didn't mind the wait, it was a lovely sunny day. The bus came in early too, the driver got off the bus, greeted me, took his belongings and locked the doors. (Pretty certain he was taking a quick morning tea break or something) An elderly gentleman comes along and I smile at him in greeting. He goes up to the bus doors, takes a look through the glass, and when he sees no driver, he tries to open the doors. He roughly pushes the doors back and forth for a few seconds, and then gives up.   


""Where is the bus driver?"" he asks me. His tone of voice is very accusing, as if he thinks it's my fault.  


""He left only a few minutes ago.""  


""Well where did he go?"" he demands. ""I don't want to be waiting all morning.""  


""I think he went to have a quick break,"" I told the old man. This did not please him at all.  


""Why did he lock the doors? Why can't I sit down on the bus and wait?""  


""I don't know, I'm not a bus driver.""  


""Can you open the doors?"" he asks me. He is getting more impatient and angry by the minute.   


""No, I don't have keys. I don't work for the bus company. I'm not the bus driver.""  


We stood in silence for a bit. Then, after a few minutes, he started checking his watch and counting every minute.  ""It's on the hour,"" he said. ""We should be getting ready to leave now."" ""It's one minute past."" ""Now it's two minutes past."" Etc, etc. The old man tried the bus doors again, as if magically, because it was 10:02 am, they would open. The bus driver came back from his ten-minute break, and the old man gave him a hard time. The bus was all of 3 minutes late leaving that particular stop."

I love the store, and their clothes feel great. So I was just walking around, keep in mind that I was wearing a Hollister Shirt, because again, I love Hollister. This Lady then comes up to me. Let's Call her Karen (Ik its overused lmao). 

&#x200B;

Karen: ""Do you know if this shirt is on sale? I'm looking for clothes for my son, and I was wondering if you knew.""

&#x200B;

Me: \*confused\* ""Uh, no I don't, sorry.""

&#x200B;

Karen: ""All the staff at this mall are straight trash, and not a single one of them want to help a single customer.""

&#x200B;

Me: \*Still very confused\* ""Ma'am, if you have a problem with the staff, why not take it to the manager?""

&#x200B;

Karen: ""What the F!? Don't pretend like you don't work here!""

&#x200B;

Me: \*confused, yet getting a little irritated with this idiot of a lady\* ""Ma'am if you excuse, I'm going to go now.""

&#x200B;

Karen: \*just looking at me, jaw hitting the floor, and then, in full Karen Mode, yells\* ""MANAGERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!""

&#x200B;

The manager, visibly concerned, goes up to Karen. 

&#x200B;

Manager: ""Ma'am, what seems to be the problem?""

&#x200B;

Karen: ""This little idiot won't help me, and instead, told me to get you.""

&#x200B;

Manager (to me): ""Sir, who are you?""

&#x200B;

Me: ""I'm a customer here, just like Karen over here""

&#x200B;

Karen: ""NO YOU AREN'T!!!! DON'T LIE TO ME YOU LITTLE CRAP! (now to the manager), AND YOU, STOP HELPING YOUR EMPLOYEES GET OUT OF DOING THEIR WORK!!""

&#x200B;

Manager: \*visibly irritated\* ""Ma'am, he doesn't work here, now stop bothering this young man and let him do his shopping!""

&#x200B;

Karen: ""I WILL HAVE NONE OF THIS!""

&#x200B;

She then proceeded to call security on the manager and me.

&#x200B;

Me and the Manager: \*exchange looks going 'WTF?' \*

&#x200B;

Security rolls in on a freakin segway. Idk how she got a hold of them.

&#x200B;

Security: ""What seems to be the problem here?""

&#x200B;

Karen: ""THESE TWO IDIOTS WON'T DO THEIR JOBS! nEiTHER oF ThEm WilL HeLp mE!!""

&#x200B;

Security (to me): ""Hey kid, (I'm 14 but barely 5'3), do you even work here? You look a little young..?""

&#x200B;

Me: \*giving security a look saying no, without responding\*

&#x200B;

Karen: ""SEE, HE'S EVEN LYING TO SECURITY!!!!!!""

&#x200B;

Me: ""Lady I tried being nice earlier, but I don't work here! I'm too young to be employed, especially here!""

&#x200B;

Security Guard: \*notices how much Karen is yelling\*

&#x200B;

The security guard then made Karen calm down, and took her out of the store. In his office, he asked her a few questions, and found out she was under the influence of something, he couldn't tell us what, and she had been taking drink after drink with it. I honestly have no idea what happened after that, because I just left. They did offer me a job there, regardless of my age though, because of how well I handled the situation. I had to decline, because school starts in a couple of weeks, but they said anytime I needed one, I could reach out to them. With that, they gave me something like 50-60 bucks in-store credit, so yeah, I got some clothes lol. I was later contacted by the manager, (I was still in the mall and they took my name), that the lady was actually arrested for disturbing the peace and harassment, but I didn't press charges. Like come on, I'm 14. I don't want to waste my last few days of freedom in court lmao."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cvk0ns/the_brushoff/,"The Brush-Off Saturday morning  I was doing some shopping at a southern grocer with green as its primary color. Employees wear white or light color dress shirts and black pants, and they all have large green name tags.

About 10 feet from me was a young woman dressed entirely in black: pants, t-shirt, and sweater. The t-shirt was logoed with one of the shopping services that also has green for a primary color. I only know this because her sweater was open just enough to reveal a couple of letters. She was pushing a cart with six paper bags, and working her phone to see what she had to get on that aisle.

Between us was a Karen. She was in her mid-60s, and staring with some confusion at the cheese selections. Apparently it was overwhelming, because she turned to the young woman and asked if she worked here.

Without looking up from her phone, the young woman replied, ""no, I do not,"" as if she has been asked every time she sets foot in the store. She continued up the aisle and did not once make eye contact with anyone.

The Karen, unsure about how to respond after the summary dismissal, stood in stunned silence for a good 2-3 seconds before trudging forward, defeated. She looked around once or twice to see if some unsuspecting green-tagged person would swoop in to her rescue, but alas. None ventured forth to save her from making a suboptimal choice.

There will be no help with the cheese today, Karen."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cvjnah/this_actually_happens/,"This actually happens! Not the most exciting story; but I just can't believe this actually happens! 

Backstory:
I'm a registered nurse. After work today my husband and I stopped by a chemist warehouse (large chemist type store) to get some ovulation and pregancy tests because we are trying for a baby. 
I'm 26 and look even younger. I'm also Russian and look like I'm of mixed Asian decent because of my heritage. I'm mentioning this because alot of the people who work at this store are younger and of Asian decent...and alot of them are female. I was still in my uniform. My uniform looks NOTHING like their uniform....but apparently it's easy to generalise if you are an older white lady. 

As I was browsing the shelves looking for something, a older white lady randomly starts talking to me. 

• Her: ""Are you serving?""

• Me confused because I can be a little heard of hearing sometimes espically when I'm trired: ""What?""

• Her sounding a little annoyed cause I said ""what' in an absent minded way: ""Are you serving?""

• Me still really confused cause it's been a long week and of working and getting my masters in nursing at the same time and I have no idea what's happening: ""No?""

• Her really annoyed now cause I'm being really dumb and a useless employee and she's considering talking to my manager🙄: ""Can you help me then?!""

• Me finally realising what was happening: ""Oh um. I don't work here.""

That's when she finally realised she was making a bit of a dick of herself. She laughed it off and said sorry because she realised I wasn't ""the help"". Totally 180 degree personality change. I laugh with her then quickly escape back to my husband before I got fried from my chemist wearhouse job. 

I would have actually helped her if she was nice about it but honestly wasn't in the mood to deal with entitled white people at this point. Honestly don't understand how you can talk like shit to people just because they are ""serving"" you.🤷🏻‍♀️ How about using ""please"" and ""excuse me"" next time?? 🐸☕

Tldr: White people am, I right?"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cv9ofl/yes_i_do_work_here/,"Yes I do work here I work at a National Park, leading tours and helping people enjoy the resource. One day a few weeks ago I came in on my day off and we just hiking around. I had finished a short hike and was just making my way back to my car. I saw a large family feeding some deer. It's not a good idea to feed deer as it gets them used to people and they can get aggressive when you run out of food. Since I wasn't in uniform or on the clock I was not going to say anything. As I walk by tho the matriarch of the family yelled at me, ""Hey you, how do we get down to the cave?"". I was a little startled as I was just minding my own business. When she said it again, I saw my opening. I put on my best Ranger smile and walked over too them. ""Hey, you couldn't have asked a better person I am actually a ranger here. How can I help?"" She kind of smiled and asked about the cave. I gave them directions and then I turned to her daughter who was still feeding the deer. ""Hey you know you are not allowed to do that."" 

The mother responded ""Why not? This is our park we can do what we want."" 

""Well you do know that these are wild animals and when they get used to humans giving them food they expect it, and if you were to run out of food and the deer want more it may get aggressive. Have you heard about what happens in Yellowstone with the bison?""

Thankfully she got a look of worry on her face and pulled her kid back from the deer. She didn't look happy but she did comply. I do think it is a little funny that I was the person that she yelled at to ask and I ended up ruining her vacation or at least that's what I heard them muttering as I walked away to drive home."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cv1tc3/these_arent_my_kids/,"These aren't my kids   

This story is a couple years old. If it doesn't fit the spirit of this sub please feel free to remove it, I just wasn't sure where else to post it. Also all dialogue is as close as I can remember, but not verbatim.

My wife and I were visiting family, their city has this winter sort of festival thing (it's cold, but they don't get heaps of snow). Everyone gets into their cold weather gear and goes out to grab some good hot food, watch some performances, ice skate etc. I was helping some family with a little home renovation (mostly the destruction part) and lost track of time. I get the ""where the hell are you?"" call from the wife and subsequently hustle my ass over there un-showered and still wearing my ""contractor"" attire. So there I am waiting in line with a mildly hangry wife wearing an old black hoodie, a beanie and my multi-pocketed builders pants. The line is pretty long but eventually splits off into maybe 1/2 dozen separate lines to get a ticket and enter the grounds. 

We get to our ticket booth and ask for two adult tickets. The girl manning the booth sort of sighs at us takes my card, runs it and says ""two adults and three kids"". Wife and I look at each other, it's pretty loud with all the people, but she definitely said three kids right? So I correct her and say, ""No just the two adults please"". Ticket lady looks like she's well and truly over this festival and its patrons tells me ""Look guy, a family pass is only 2 extra bucks and the kids have to be counted for fire safety."" My generally happy demeanour is starting to slip, ""I said two adults please, we don't have any kids!"" Ticket lady leans out of the booth, points down and says in her best teenage sass ""Well what are those?"" I follow her finger and f\*\*k me if there aren't  three kids right next to me.

The kids are maybe 8, 5 and 3??? I'm bad with kids ages, but I have relatives with kids those ages and that seemed about right. The biggest one has a hand gripping my knee pocket on my pants, he's holding another little-er boys hand and the little-er boy is holding the hand of a little girl. I'm just sort of staring at these little people, ticket lady is smugly triumphant and it's up to my wife to save the day. ""Yeah these aren't our kids, we have no idea where they came from."" Ticket lady looks sceptical (fair enough, we have these kids, kids don't just randomly appear, except apparently when they do) until the oldest kid looks up, sees a total stranger and starts to cry (doesn't let go of my pocket though). ""Yeah these are not our kids"". Ticket lady is looking less sure of herself. I'm confused how my leg has sprouted three sentient beings and I didn't even notice. It's up to my wife to point out the obvious ""Where are these kids parents?"" Now we're all frantically looking around for some parents but not seeing anybody. Ticket lady gets on the radio and a security guy comes up and leads us away to lost and found. We sort have to go with them cause the kid has a death grip on my pocket and refuses to let go. The two youngest ones seem largely oblivious to the whole thing.

So there we are, parked in lost and found. They're nice people and sort us out some hot drinks and cookies. They're gently asking the oldest kid if he knows mom and dads phone number (he doesn't) and he isn't keen on giving out their names to strangers. Security guy says that this is pretty common, they get a cop to come in and the kid starts to spill all the details. The combination of cop, food and drinks convince the kids to release their iron grips on my pocket and one another. Security tells me we can go, but at that point we feel a bit responsible so we hang around. I also wanted to see the idiot that let the kids go, so we just kinda waited. Didn't have to wait too long in the end. A frantic guy ran up to the tent, and the mystery of how I became the accidental father of three kind of solved itself. Guy looked just like me, tall, beard, black hoodie, builders pants. Obviously our faces were different, but to a little kid, how often do you look up and your parents when you're walking along? Turns out that this husband and wife both though that the kids were holding the other ones hand, went into the festival and immediately realised the kids were missing. He had to run the length of the venue to get to the exit, she stayed at the entrance in case the kids walked through. When the dad got to the ticket stand we were already gone so he ran to security and eventually got pointed in the right direction. He calls his wife and I can hear her crying with relief. The cop tells us that this apparently happens all the time, kid wipes his nose and grabs the leg that looks like the right one and the family separates. We shake hands with the dad and the cop, hand off the kids and go back to the ticket line. 

A slightly less smug ticket lady reverses the family charge on my card and lets us in for free. We had a good time and got a story out of it, so I guess all's well that ends well."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cvgnwb/parking_without_pay/,"Parking Without Pay I joined Reddit just for this (until anything else happens of course . . .) My family and I live in an RV and are living for about two or more years at this RV Park. My brother and I were on our way to the laundromat, right next to the front office. First, we saw an old lady smoking two feet away from the ""No Smoking"" sign. We ignored her and moved on, but her husband (I think) stopped us.

""Excuse me, are you two residents here?""

We said, ""Um, yes.""

""Now I'm 90 years old and can't move on any further. Is it okay if we park right over there and pay in the morning?"" He seemed pretty lively and not tired at all.

My brother responded with ""I don't think you can do that . . .""

He just continued. ""You see, we're heading to Kansas. Kansas City, the ol' big city. We could just park over there, or maybe there."" He pointed to two front spots. ""Yeah, I think we'll just park over there. If someone tells us to move we'll just say I'm 90 years old and can't move no further. Thank you, you two.""

We were very confused but finished our laundry. I told my mom, who knows more about the park. She said they weren't supposed to do that. The front spots are in fact for full-time residents that pay for spots monthly. And as it's Sunday, they'll probably be coming back from the weekend. Not to mention there's a large sign on the front office that says ""No Walk-Ins Allowed"". Everyone here reserves their spaces ahead of time.

So, we called the after-hours staff. He said they weren't supposed to do that. As we were putting our laundry in the dryer, the staff walked in and asked if we were the ones to call. When we said yes, he looked at his list and said they weren't on it and would have to kick them out. And you know the funniest part? They parked right next door to the manager of the park . . .

I hope you enjoyed! Maybe someday rSlash will cover this, because he's awesome and I watch him all the time. ;)"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cv0z90/i_just_wanted_to_eat_my_shabu_shabu/,"I just wanted to eat my Shabu Shabu..... Recently, I've become addicted to the little authentic Asian restaurants in my neighborhood. I also have found that I adore Japanese hot pot, also known as Shabu Shabu. Now, the owners of my local Shabu Shabu place are a lovely older generation couple (*likely in their 60s*) with bare minimum knowledge of technology and minimal ability to speak English. They do speak Korean and Japanese fluently as the wife is from Korea and the husband from Japan *(this becomes important*). I don't speak fluent Japanese and no Korean--but the owners are smart and created a menu with pictures for their English only guests.

I love eating there. I go about 1 time every 2-3 weeks and I definitely will pick this Hot Pot place over all the other ones around. I love that it's fresh and I've gotten to know the owner's sister and kids (*who work in this family run business too*) pretty well. In fact, the owner's sister is going to culinary school and she often likes to test new recipes she's trying out with me. Food is truly a universal language for us and most of the neighborhood. Now, while this place is authentic, that also means that a majority of their customers come in because they know exactly what they want and when. Shabu Shabu is mainly a self-serve kind of thing (*you can look it up if you want more info)* and the place is basically a seat yourself after you inform people your there. They will come for soup, meat and drink orders, but everything else is self serve with a near buffet style for veggies and add ons to the hot pot.

So, I went yesterday with my Mom and we really enjoyed our time. It was a Friday Happy Hour and because I'm loyal customer, I got a nice discount and no-charge on my sodas. ANYWAY, while my mom's sitting eating her soup, I get up to get some freshly made white rice that the owner has set up with a nearby pot for customers to go grab from (*in a small bowl of course*). I am making my bowl when the wild Karen and her kid *(about 12-14 years of age)* enters through the front door. I start spending my time picking out a topping for the rice (*which they left sauces and whatnot next to the rice for us to do too)*.

The Wild Karen begins making a huffing nose. When I glance behind me, I see that the owner's daughter is still prepping a desert on the patio for a couple and that the other server (*his sister*) is loaded down with multiple dishes of cold meat to set out at the different tables for waiting customers. I shrug and finish prepping my rice before heading over to my Mom.

I didn't know the Wild Karen had followed me. She waited until I was moving to sit to grab me *(literally grab me*) by the arm.

**Karen:** Where the heck are you going?! You need to seat my child and i

**Me;** Uh--I don't work here. You just need to get a table and someone will come, eventually.

**Karen:** What the heck kind of joke service is this! You need to serve me like you did this fatso. (*she pointed at my mom*).

There were clearly 2 set up plates and drinks and everything--so it was kind of obvious that I had just been at the table eating. Annoyed and not wanting to deal with her, I start trying to pull my arm away.

**Me:** Lady, let go.

**Karen:** Not until you seat me.

**Me:** Lady, I just want to eat my dinner. Leave me alone.

Karen went ballistic and begins to yell at me loudly. I won't type a repeat--but there were words given out that no child should hear from their parents, including racial slurs. I pull my arm free at the same time the owner's sister comes to stop her--and crazy Karen scratched down the side of my arm in full view of everyone. Not enough to bleed but enough to leave a light mark.

Sister of the owner started yelling at woman in Korean. Soon enough, the entire family is yelling at her in Korean. I just kind of stood there, staring. My Mom looked like something funny was happening while she pulled me away. The commotion called the security guard--who likes to park their cart just outside in the main entrance to the strip mall. The owner in his broken English had the woman and her kid kicked out. She threw such a fit that the guard banned her from the strip mall for a week on the way out. When she finally drove off, I chatted with the owner's daughter a bit who promised me a sweet ice cream treat for after dinner for the trouble.

When I sat down, my Mother stared laughing. I asked her why she was laughing and she explained that during the confrontation, the owner's wife, daughter and sister were using their Korean to name call the woman the most creative offensive names she'd ever heard. When the owner's sister came with apologetic ice cream after our meal, my Mom told her in Korean that she loved the food and show.

Turns out that my blonde, blue eyed and clearly white mother was the only person in the entire restaurant aside from the family that spoke enough Korean to understand what they were yelling and it was ALL creative insults. They didn't even try to talk about serving her--all that was said was that she scratched me, one of the best customers they had and they full on started a contest on who could insult her the best--hence why my Mom had a hard time keeping from laughing. By the end of what my mom had translated, everyone in the place with us was laughing and back to the happy mood. I am so glad I enjoy this place so much and can't wait until next week, Mom and I are planning on taking our family friend there when she flies in.......from South Korea.

TLDR: Wild Karen thinks I work for restaurant, scratches me while trying to make me work for it; and the owners insult her in Korean until forcing her to leave. Mom waits till after and translates play-by-play and everyone has a good time, except the wild Karen.

Edit: Oh my gosh! I've never received a silver before! Thank you so much!

By popular demands, here are a few insults that my Mom translated that we are still joking about:

Daughter of Owner - Who would want to breed with a donkey head like you but seeing as the dad isn't here, it must be visitation time. Shrew b\*\*\*\*.

Sister of Owner - Your swollen head means you caught a guy through that mouth--cause he had to shut you up somehow.

Wife of Owner - Someone should feed you to pigs, cause then you'll get service like your demanding, idiot.

As for name calling:

Daughter of Owner - stinky pig-chewing, dog loving, shrew

Owner's Wife: pink and yellow (what she was wearing), spotted thing with an afro in the wrong place

Owner's Sister - wannabe barbie doll but can't do enough exercise and looks more like a drag queen.

I ended up at the nearby Tessa Cohen. The empolyes there wear blue, just for some context, and I was wearing a deadpool shirt and jeans. 

I was at the games eisle when I heard clicking behind me. This annoyed me, partly becuase I was still annoyed about my previous arguement, but also because of how rude she was.

I ignored it, and soon enough I had a hand clench my arm and jerk me around. There she was.

Karen, devourer of joy.

""I have been trying to talk to you for 5 minutes. Are you going to help me or are am I going to have to get a manager?""

I stared blankly at her.

""Honestly, if you can't find a member of normal staff I doubt you can find a manager""

She scoffed at me. ""I have found one you idiot, YOU. Now, help me or your gett-""

""I don't work here""

""Yes you do, your here all the time""

I laughed and said to her, in the most condescending voice possible ""Well maybe because this is the closest store to my house, and because I like shopping here. If you actually used your brain you would realise that, wouldn't you Karen?""

I turned around and she began screeching

""That's it. YOU ARE COMING WITH ME RIGHT NOW"" She grabbed my wrist and yanked, her nails dug in and caused me to bleed.

I was in a bad mood, and the pain caused me to flip. I punched her in the gut with the hand she had grabbed, causing her to let go. 

""I WANT THIS PEICE OF SHIT FIRED. HE JUST ASSAULTED ME FOR NO REASON""

The staff member asked me why I did that, and I explained the story, showing the marks on my arm. He told the woman to leave or he would call security. She screeched about managers and left. The employee told me that when I was done to find him and he would let me out through the back door to avoid her.

I regret assaulting her but she honestly deserved it."

The other day I got on the train let's call it line 1 at station 1 and took it to Station 2 went to the library got back on at station 2 and accidentally caught the wrong train (line 1 instead of line 2 which goes back home). Got off at station 3 when I realized I went the way, waited for 30 minutes for line 2 to get there when it did I got on and waited and wondered why the door wasn't closing yet, then ""THIS IS xx FROM xx CONTROL CENTER, THIS TRAIN IS DELAYED DUE TO A HOLD UP AT STATION 2. WE ARE EXPECTING MAJOR DELAYS ON ALL INBOUND / OUTBOUND SERVICES. WE APPOLOGISE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE CAUSED BY THIS."" Played over the speaker. I kept waiting then decided to get on the other line because they said delays estimated to be up to 4 hours. Anyway got to station 12 and stayed on the train (because our trains here in Melbourne just go back the other way without changing tracks) we got to station 6 and they said (the speakers were quiet and there was a lot of noise) ""PLEASE LEAVE THE TRAIN, A PASSENGER HAS HAD A SEIZURE AT STATION 3. REPLACEMENT BUSSES ARE OPERATING."" and barely anybody heard it then there were a few people wondering why it wasn't moving I told around 3p people that somebody had a seizure at station 3 and we need to take replacement busses to anywhere further. 29 people thanked me but 1 (our star of the show, Karen!) got upset at me here's how it went:

K: why do I need to get off?
Me: a passenger had a seizure and threw up on a train making it have to stop.
K: **starts being aggressive to me**
Me: it's not my choice sadly.
K: MAKE THE TRAIN MOVE YOU METRO DOG!
Me: I don't work here lady.
K: YES YOU DO!
Me: actually I don't.
K: IF YOU DON'T AND I ALREADY KNOW YOU DO THEN WHY ARE YOU MAKING PEOPLE GET OFF THE TRAIN?!?!?
(Note: I never said people have to get off the train just told them why it's not moving) 
Me: I'm not making anyone get off the train just explaining why the metro employees are kicking people off the train.
K: SHUT UP AND TAKE ME TO STATION 1! 
Me: believe whatever you want lady, but for the millionth time I. DO. NOT. GOD. DAMN. WORK. HERE.

Title: Look up

Starring:

Me as Me

Evan as Stupid Entitled Brat

Grandma as Evan's Granny

Marvin as my classmate and Evan's neighbor

So, fair warning, English isn't my first language but I am not on mobile! (And then everyone got up and started clapping.)

TL;DR at the bottom. 

Anyway, so about a year ago, when I was fifteen, my ex-elementary school teacher got me a job tutoring a boy who had some trouble at school, Evan.

I am super happy and originally expect a normal tutoring job: maybe two lessons a week, earning like 40€ a month, just something small to boost my budget a little. 

However, when I meet up with Evan's Grandma who he is for some reason living with (I guess his parents are a little... off, because I do meet his dad a little bit down the road and he is totally still in the picture) I find out two things: 1. Grandma is *rich*. and 2. Evan's problems can't be confined into ‘some little trouble at school', the kid's struggle is real. 

It turns out I'll need to come over every day to help Evan with his homework and will get 8€ per hour. And as Evan often needed more than an hour a day, every month I end up with about 200€. 

That's huge. I'm in heaven. I buy a Nintendo Switch after two months.

But, as they say, if something's too good to be true it probably is. 

Because, as I find out rather quickly, Evan is, I kid you not, the dumbest kid in the entire universe. He's in sixth grade, already about a year older than all of his classmates, and he can't multiply 11 by 2. He doesn't know who Hitler was. Reading an A4 page of writing out loud takes him about 30 minutes. 

And I mean- it's fine! I'm a *Rick And Morty* fan so I understand that not everyone can stand up to my 9000-multiplied-by-infinity IQ. 

But the problem with Evan is, he's an entitled little shit too. 

I've mentioned how his Grandma is basically our local Rockefeller? So yeah, the kid gets everything, and I mean **everything** he asks for. Newest phone, newest console, the most expensive LEGO sets on the market. 

I've witnessed him chew his Granny out because she bought the wrong Actimel sort. Made him really unlikable.

He doesn't respect money at all, and not only his (or rather his family's) but also mine as well. Evan often forgets that he has a big project due tomorrow so he sends me a quick text, “Could you buy X, Y and Z on your way here?” And fighting to get the money spend on that is a real bitch. 

So yeah, the money is good but working with Evan isn't. I often return home at eight, sometimes Evan refuses to do his homework before he finishes watching a Fortnite stream, one time he orders me to give him my Switch charger because he lost his. 

And overall? He just doesn't put any effort into school. And he should! Let me explain the German school system after elementary school for ya, nice and easy: 

You smart, you wanna go to college?- You go to *Gymnasium.* 

You don't wanna go to college?- You go to *Oberschule*, *Realschule* or *Haupschule.* 

You not smart at all?- You go to *Förderschule* or a different school for children who require special attention (My region just had a *Förderschule*). 

I don't want you Germans coming at me now- I know it's a very rough description but that's basically how it works around where I live. 

So anyway- Evan's dream is getting into our local *Oberschule.* But for that to work he needs to have specific grades, otherwise they'll put him into the *Förderschule.* 

And he doesn't work at all! His grades are going downhill, he's not telling me about tests and homework- I have to start taking his journal and checking it myself and after that, he just doesn't write the stuff he doesn't feel like doing into the journal so I don't know about it. 

So that, the fact that Evan takes up hours of my afternoons, doesn't respect me at all and that he probably won't make it into his dream school and I don't feel like getting a mouthful from his Grandma for not getting his grades to get better- I quit. 

I tell Grandma that I'm leaving around Christmas- promising I'll still do two weeks of January with him and offering to find some replacement. 

But Evan says he doesn't need anyone new, he'll just manage himself and get Marvin, one of my classmates whose curse is being Evan's neighbor (poor guy is too nice to tell him to F off), to help him. 

So yeah, fine! I work my two weeks, collect my money and tell Evan goodbye. 

A few days of silence, I just enjoy my freedom. Then I get a text from Evan, around the time I usually tutored him: “Where are you?”

I'm like lol, what's up with that kid? So I text him: “I don't tutor you anymore.”

Evan: “Can you come? Marvin is busy.”

And that's where I screw up- I come because I know Evan is totally through if someone doesn't help him. 

But oh, Marvin is busy quite a lot. Because not that much later, Evan texts me again: “Can you come, Marvin can't today.” 

Me: “Can't, it's my birthday, I have family over.”

Few minutes of silence. Then:

Evan: “Where are you?” (He sometimes texted me that if I was running late for our meeting.)

Me: “I told you, I can't come today. Besides, I don't work for you anymore, find someone else.” 

Again, I swear, while I don't have the exact messages in mind, I remember Evan waits a few minutes after me telling him that I will not come to go broken record on me and ask “Where are you?” again a couple more times. 

I finally explode and write him a longer, a bit harsher message telling him to leave me alone. So it stops for that day. 

Then, next day, he comes again: “When will you be here today?”

And that's where I just blocked him everywhere. 

I don't know and care what happened, but Evan's family stopped greeting me from that day on. 

TL;DR: Kid is a nightmare to tutor, when I quit he just acts as if I didn't and keeps texting me to come to his house."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cuve2l/listen_i_am_going_to_get_you_fired_and_make_sure/,"Listen I am going to get you fired and make sure you never have a job. So this will be my first post to Reddit and the I don't work here thing.

Let me introduce the characters of my interesting meeting with a very entitled lady.

Me - M

EL - Entitled Lady

PE - Poor Employee that some how lived through this

PM - Poor Manager that called it a Tuesday.

So let me begin this happened back in the year 1999 and I was 19 years old in the Army and I looked nothing like an employee at this local Walmart. So I had just got my very first career job which is the army then I was excited about being in the army with that sad I was able to rent my own place and was stoked at being a real adult. Or so I thought, so when I finally got leave to go on vacation or leave as they call that in the military, I decided to head to Walmart and buy a bed and a TV so I could just veg out in my place with my own rules. So dressed in my PT Uniform I went to Walmart, as I was walking up and down the isles, this older lady asked me for a bit of help to load a microwave into her cart. Being the totally nice guy I am I said no problem, that was Mistake 1, Mistake 2 I told her to have a good day. As I returned to my mission someone EL tapped on my shoulder, immediately she demanded I get her something off the shelf, the only reason I said no us cause she snapped her fingers at me like I was some kinda of servant. I told her no and went about my business, Mistake 3. She started up a huge storm of cussing at me and telling me I don't belong in her country anyways. For context I am a very dark brown and my hair is straight, a lot of people think I am Mexican or from the middle East. I am not I am half black and white. Anyways as she is screaming at me and I am simply tuning her out. Which in my retrospect I should have told her to stop this PE shows up and she is instantly her next target, this EL ripped into this poor girl who was seconds from crying. Again I step in and tell her that she is a rude little person (I was a bit more colorful but I am keeping this post PG13). Just as I finish my triad of telling her off in steps this PM. Again the lady goes into graphic detail how I called her a string of bad words and she wanted me fire. The PM looks at me and I assume he is ex military and says madam he doesn't work here and he is clearly in the Army, hence the words on his clothes. She turns bright red with anger or embarrassment.. after about 25 seconds of quite she looks me in the eye and says she wants my bosses number so she can get me fired etc etc. I obliged and give her my Captain's number. Then she says once I learn your name I am going to make sure you never get a job in this state again. I nearly died from laughing. I walk away thinking it's over.. Boy was I wrong it ended up being funny as hell but just wow..

About 4 days after this I have kinda of forgotten about the whole ordeal at first.. I then get a call from my CO asking for me to see him ASAP. I get down to his office when blow me over the EL is in his office saying yes that's him, now fire him. My CO has her leave so I can tell my half, this ended up being like a 3 day investigation. The only reason why so long is cause they needed footage from that Walmart, which clearly show I did nothing wrong. So a day or so later it's me my CO and the EL sitting in his office. He explains that not only was I not getting punished but we have requested a restraining order against the EL. She lost her mind and was escorted off base.. luckily for me I have yet to run back into her

I do hope you guys find my one interesting day to be awesome"
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cus1lg/nope_i_dont_work_here_anymore/,"Nope, I don't work here anymore So, this may be a bit long, that's just because of the backstory involved.  In 2017 I worked at Walmart in the Automotive Repair part as a technician.  Basically, my job was to do oil changes and tire rotations, the most boring and menial of tasks for someone who had gone to school to be a mechanic, but I digress.  I got let go in November of 2017 (Another story for another day), and have since gone on to work at another retail store and a gas station just down the road from me.  Now, the retail store's uniform is all black, the gas station has a black polo with the store logo and khaki/tan pants, whereas Walmart employees have blue shirts, khaki pants and, often, vests (Or distinct uniforms if in the auto shop + work glasses).  Now that I've given the uniform information and my minor backstory, on to the nightmare Karen

&#x200B;

Cast: Me, Former Manager, henceforth known as 'Jim' and Karen

&#x200B;

I went in to Walmart the other day to get new shoes, as mine had finally bit the dust and needed replaced so I could work in comfort.  I found the shoes I wanted/needed easily (Size 13 4E, aka 13 Extra Wide) and proceeded to checkout.  I was in my gas station uniform, as I'd just gotten off work, but I also had on this black and grey flannel my sisters got me for Christmas last year, and I love it.  I also had my earbuds in so I could tune out my former coworkers and managers.  As I walked I could hear some noise through my earbuds, but I ignored it until I felt the signature pain of one being yanked out of my ear, which prompted a not too polite response.

Me: What the actual fuck?!  You do NOT pull someones earbuds out like that!  The fuck do you want?!

Karen, a 50 ish woman with that Karen hairdo, cheap sunglasses and a VERY ugly green shirt: That is no way to talk to a customer!  Now, tell me where I can find colored pencils for my son for school!

Me: Fuck off, I don't work here and even if I did I wouldn't want to help you

Karen, unamused: You WILL show me where they are, and when we're done I want to talk to your manager!

Me, realizing this won't end until she gets what she wants: Fine, I'll show you where they are.

I had seen Jim in that aisle beforehand, and I knew he'd deal with her before I blew a gasket at this miserable bitch.   So, I lead Karen right to the aisle and, thankfully, Jim is still there talking to a trainee.  For clarification, Jim is a 6'1"", 400ish pound black gentleman who is fair to his employees and to customers, when they're fair with him.

Karen: Thank you, now go get me your manager so I can complain

Jim, turning having hearing this: What can I do for you?

Karen, smirking: Perfect!  This employee was listening to music on the job and being rude to me

Me, rolling my eyes: No, I was shopping for my new job and she came up behind me and yanked an earbud out and screamed at me unfairly.

Jim looks at me and chuckles: Ma'am, he doesn't work here, hasn't since right before Thanksgiving.

Karen, furious: Bullshit!  I KNOW he works here!  Go get me your store manager so I can get you and him fired!

This is the time I'd like to point out, Jim IS the store manager.  Well, one of the two, and BOTH were on duty that day, but the other one was on his lunch break

Jim: Ma'am, I am the store manager.  He doesn't work here, I was here when we let him go, I signed his paperwork and shook his hand while he was respectful to me.  He's a respectful young man and if anything he reacted like that because you were rude to him.  Now, you can either keep your mouth shut and apologize to both of us, or you can leave the store and never come back, your choice.

Karen does NOT like this and snaps, going to take a swing at Jim, who took the punch with the grace of a saint.  Karen turned to me, seeing my phone in my hand: What do you think you're doing?!

Me: Getting a picture for the police when they get here.

At that moment the 911 dispatcher I had on speaker spoke up and Karen went white.

Me:Oh, and I caught the video of you hitting Jim in the face because you didn't get your way, I'll gladly give it to the cops when they get you in cuffs.

&#x200B;

Already long story short, Karen was arrested and Jim charged her with assault, I got my shoes and the police took my video as evidence.  Karen has been banned from that store and, aside from a bit of a mark, Jim is fine and laughed about it while I paid for my shoes.

&#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I have several stories from my time at Walmart that I may share another time.  Have a wonderful day!

&#x200B;

Edit: For clarification, thanks to my sleep deprived brain being stupid when I posted this.  I took the video when she first raised her voice at Jim, and I stopped it right after she sucker punched him and proceeded to call 911 via speed dial.  She was screaming other things that I don't really remember, but I do remember he ignoring me while I relayed the incident to the dispatcher.  Sorry for confusing anyone!

&#x200B;

Edit 2: To whoever it was who asked me about the picture(I can't find your comment now, been too busy to reply), I baited her.  I wanted to see how she'd react.  My phone's not good enough to get a picture during a video, though I wish it had been."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cv65mr/5_out_of_10_times/,"5 out of 10 times... Sometimes I think life wants to tell me that I choose the wrong job. But I reaaally don't want to work with customers face to face. Been there done that...Left them the Tshirt. I'd rather have them on the phone where I can mute them till they calm down. 

But back to the Mainstory. It's not as spectacular as most others here. 

But it seems like there is no shop I can go to and no matter what cloth or shirt I wear (Marvel or Doctor Who or B5 or ST or....)

And no those Shirts definitely had a different color then the shop uniforms almost everytime.

But it seem like 5 out 10 times when I am in a shop a person comes to ask me something. It happens so often and because I was raised politely most of the times when I know the shop I just point them in the right direction. 

But it's still fun when we then later on meet at the  cashier. 

It's also always funny to see them doubletake after asking me when they realise it after I told them ""Sorry no I don't know where the xxx is or when xxx will be restocked."" 

Funnily (and I've played this game for 20 years now) none of them where ever insulting or agressiv. 

Many of them are even more kind when they realise that it actually really wasn't my job as I don't  work there and still helped them."

   back in 2015 me and my gf at the time decided to go on our first vacation.  she was a big potter head and always said she wanted to go to the wizarding world. so that's where we went as i wanted to make her happy. i am 32 and she is 26 for anyone who wants to know.

   we get there and the first thing she wanted to do was go to the many shops and get basically everything. interactive wand, uniform, socks, cloak, tie the works. she gets me to buy a few parts to from slithering. the park lets you wear any of the items you buy there as employee uniforms and in park stuff look different. we go back to the hotel so she can change properly.  she is now in full hufflepuff uniform from head to toe.

   i am in the few slythern items i bought to make her happy cloak and non interactive wand. we get back to the park and she wants to test her interactive wand out in the designated areas.  shes having a blast she waves her wand and stuff happens.  a few kids here and there run up to her and ask for help with there wand as they see her getting hers to work.  she enjoys that she loves kids.

  me however start to notes we are the only ones our age dressed up and i just know sooner or latter we are going to have a i don't work here moment. and surprise surprise i was right. now the first few where ok some parents asking question where things are and what not i had a map on me so i could point it out. one couple was asking about train times (we where like 15 feet from the train posting) so i pointed it out.  some of us had a laugh when they realized we didn't work there. for the most part i was glad we where not having anyone crazy until....

   so after a time maybe around 2pm we got hungry.  so we went into one of the restaurants for some potter food (butterbeer is literally just butterscotch soda with marshmallow froth). started looking at one of the menus and we get stopped by one of the real employees (she looked around 25ish normal looking with long hair not a typical looking Karen) who starts yelling at us.

   why are you out of your area you know your not aloud to come in here and eat if your on brake you need to go to the crew brake room. she looks at me and says and you your not even in full uniform i am going to be speaking to (random boss name) about you. she starts backhand clapping at me and says chop chop get back to work (this part i remembered the most as i hate when people do that).

   i don't have anxiety or communication problems or anything else most people have now a days i was military and i been yelled at by much worse lol.

 so i just take one look at her and start laughing call her stupid (i might have been a little more rude cant really remember :/)  for thinking we work there as an employee you should know better on the difference in work uniforms and the gift shop uniforms i can forgive normal vacationers for not knowing but you are an employee and by far the most rude person i have seen today. now get out of our faces go back to work or i will be talking to (boss name she said before) about you (her name she had a name tag on i don't remember it) for harassing park guests.

   the smirk left her face she took a 2ed look at us and just turned around and left didn't see her again. the rest of the day went fine enjoyed rides had snacks and had a great time still had a few normal people ask things all nice about it and most were where stuff was and if i knew pointed it out or handed them a map (i made shore to grab a few extra maps lol). the next day nether me or my gf went in uniform.


EDIT: what is it with you people and punctuation's. i have plenty of periods, commas and spacing. it is not a big deal to not have a capital letters.  i have read and reread my post many times if you cant understand this get some reading comprehension. lay off this isn't high school and i am not writing a book. i have seen way worse.  its just a simple story that i was sharing take it for what it is."

A woman approached me and asked me about her car making noises and if I can repair it.

I pointed to the really large Opel sign on my overall and told her I could give her car a look but the people working here won't let me use their equipment to repair it. 

As soon as she realized, we both laughed about it. She talked to a real employee and got help."

So I work at a large theme park in the UK that has a rather distinct dark blue uniform. On my way to work I had to decided to stop at a local craft store to pickup some stitching supplies. Why not? I was nearly done with my latest project but had run out of thread last minute. 

The craft store had a blue uniform as well, but there uniform was a light, washed out blue with a button down shirt, and red apron. I was wearing a blue polo and black shorts, and certainly no apron...

I spent a few minutes looking round the shop and found the thread section. While I was perusing for the right colour, an older lady (60-70) attempted to get my attention:

Lady: ""Excuse me""

Me: (No response as I had headphones in and was deeply fascinated with the thread)

Lady: ""Excuse me!""

Me: (Removes headphones, customer service mode activate) ""sorry can I help you"" 

Lady: ""Yes..."" (pause as realisation hits her). ""Do you know where to find X item...""

Me: ""No sorry"" (gesturing to my uniform)

Lady: ""Oh, you don't work here do you...""

Me: ""No, I'm afraid not, I work for Y theme park""

Lady: (Disappears into the store and is never seen again...)

To be honest I never did find the right thread and had to order it online. Not as extreme as some posts but I was genuinely surprised someone could confuse a customer for an employee."

Earlier today, I was at the local Walmart when I truly believe I almost had an IDWHL moment. But before I can give the story, I believe some background information is important.

I am a rather large guy. I stand about 6' 1ish"" barefoot. A few days ago at the doctor's office, I tipped the scales at 268. And while I do have a bit of a gut (round is a shape), I also have a 46 to 48 inch chest. Like I said, big guy. In my life, I served 10+ years in a combat arms job in the military, worked a year plus as a bouncer, certified as both a professional bodyguard and a counter-terrorism instructor, and basically been a professional asshole for most of the last 20 years. As such, I have very little tolerance for dealing with stupid. I also live in a small border town and while most Canadians are really nice, some are utter DICKS!

On my way to Walmart, I had to deal with idiot drivers that had no clue where they wanted to turn. Followed by a pair of stupid Canadians talking right in the middle of the FREAKIN DOOR!! Needless to say, my stupid quotient was full and I was not in the best of moods.

So, I'm at Walmart and I decided that I was going to look at firearm accessories and targets so I can attempt to budget for my best range day. Just as I put back the bipod I was contemplating, I hear what I believe is the classic Karen ""Excuse me?"".

So, I turn and look at her (remember I'm done with stupid at this point) and give her my ""1000 yard, I'm going to kill you and every living relative you have if you do/say something dumb"" stare.

K: ""Do you know where....."" She started with that whole ""entitled, you will serve me"" tone and just tapered off to nothing.

Me: Death glare continues.

K: ""eep!"" (Yes folks, she actually eeped) 

At that point Karen turned tail and walked away as fast as she could without breaking into a jog.

I proceeded to go about my business and got the few items I was there for.

I told my wife what happened after she got home and we both had a laugh about it.

TLDR: Professional asshole death glared a Karen into silence."

Me: ""Hi, do you have these shoes in a 10?"" 

Guy: ""No, I don't know."" He looked really embarassed.

Me: gasping in embarrassment, ""Oh my god, you don't work here do you?!""

I keep reading really hilarious stories on this subject in many different subs, like the revenge subs, malicious compliance etc.etc.etc.  so why not give them their very own sub ? /r/youdontworkhereanymorelady was too long, so I decided on /r/youarefired/    

Please help it row by spreading the word, posting storiesm, make comments etc. and if people wanna help mod it, tell me in  a few days when this viral story has died down, or it will drown in all the comments I get on this post.




First a little explanation, here in Germany we have Bundesländer (kinda like the states in the us, but way less independant). Since the school system is up to the BL they often started their summer vacations at different times (the biggest reason being chaos in the highway system if everybody would want to drive to summer vacation on the same day). Also this is not  a recent story but quite  a few years ago.

My niece is from bavaria, i am from baden wuerttemgberg. Her summer vacation started a whole week earlier the ours, and she came for a visit with my brother and her siblings. It was like in the morning and we decided to take doggo for walk and go to the bakery on the other side of the street of a big school complex. I went in, she stayed outside with doggo, Í came back out and she was gone. Let us introduce our protagonists.

PP :principle pissant

Me : take a guess

N : niece.

I decided to call her on the cellphone, and this was the talk.

N : thank god you are calling.....

PP (Screaming in the background) : how dare you take a phonecall while I am talking to you, you are in enough trouble for skipping class....

As I later found out he ripped the phone out of her hand, and must have hung up. I realized what must have happened, and went into the school to clear up this misunderstanding, and go right away to the principles office hoping she would either be there or soon be brought by  a teacher.

Outside I already hear him screaming at her

PP : stop giving me a fake name and stop lying, you won´t get out of here until i have the truth, and I promise you this will be mentioned in your school certificate (we have grades for general behaviour here, and teachers can also write a comment in there. It is something employers care about if you look for an apprenticeship for example).

I did not bother knocking and went right in.

PP : who are you and how dare you just come in here without knocking

Me : I am this girls uncle, what the hell do you think you are doing here ? She does not go to your school !!!

PP : Ah I guess you where the one on the phone, nice try, but you will not help her trick her way out of this. I will get to the bottom of this, and I will only release her to her parents. Now get out of my office or I will call the police and have you arrested for trespassing in a school (school are protected places, so you get in way more trouble here for trespassing then usual)

Me : I will stay right here to protect my niece from your crazy ass, and calling the cops sounds like a really good idea, after all you have abducted my niece.

 So I did the call and just told the police that my niece got abducted and to come to the principles office asap.

PP : do you really expect me to believe your fake phonecall ?
 her un till the police is here
The  he started to shout at my niece again ,who was in tears by now.

ME : STOP FUCKING SHOUTING AT MY NIECE, you will not address her till the police is here, or I WILL shut you up.

PP :that is it, i am calling the police now, to have you arrested and finally find out her real name.

So he called the police, only to find out I actually did call the police. Suddenly he was not so sure anymore, and you could tell the cogs in his head where finally start to turn.

About 5 minutes later the police finally arrived, and they asked us separately. Here is roughly what my niece told the cops.

She was waiting outside the bakery, when PP came unto her like  ab at from hell. He screamed at her that he is really fed up with people skipping school the last week before vacation starts, and will make an example pout of her. Before she could get a word in edgewise, he grabbed her by the arm really hard (hard enough she got a bad bruise for over a week), and that is what started to get him into real trouble. The cops also took her data, and confirmed she is from Bavaria. They then asked us if we want to press charges and I just said throw the book at him. PP heard the police sayíng press charges and suddenly realized he was in real deep shit, so he came over.

PP : hey this is just a misunderstanding, you have to understand I have to be strict with people skipping school.

Me : if by being strict you mean assaulting a  12 year old´so badly she has a handprint from you on her arm that will create a huge ruise, abducting her from my care, and wrongfully imprison her in your office while screaming at her and scaring the beejezus out of her, then no I DO NOT HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT !!!
 
PP : please you are completely blowing this out of proportion, I could get suspended without pay over this,and even lose my job. 

Me : GOOD, anyody who treats a scared 12 year old girl like that should never again get to work with kids.


In the end he really did lose his job, and I am very glad he did. During the investigation it turned out he was a sorry excuse for a teacher, who belittled kids, who always took the teachers side no mater how wrong they where and even had slapped kids on several occasions. He went to court for assault and attempted abducting plus wrongful imprisonment, plus a few more bodily harms against students. He lost job and pension, got 2 years on probation and 500 hours community service with the stipulation it could be nothing that involved kids. He was also forbidden to ever work with kids again."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cuk8m5/this_isnt_you_child_lady/,"""This isn't you child lady"" So this is more of a ""This isn't your child"" situation. For the record, I am female, I have a lot of tattoos (full sleeves, leg tattoos, and neck) and piercings, no children of my own and don't typically look like a 'go to the park with a kid' type of person. This was also a few years ago so the dialog is to the best of my memory and my niece is older now.

I have a niece that is 5 and I take her to the park or take out and spend time with her about twice a week. I enjoy spending time with her and most of the time we go to the park to hang out and play around. 

The last time we went to the park, we were playing and along the way she made a friend. Her and her insta friend went off and started playing. I went to sit on one of the benches to watch over her and relax for a bit. 

The next thing I know a woman approaches the two kids (the mother of my nieces new friend) and starts taking BOTH of them to her minivan. I immediately run over and tell my niece that she can't get into the van. 

The following conversation goes like this. I will be Me, she will be CM: crazy mother and PD: will be the officer.

ME: Olivia, don't get in there. Come with me, we need to get going. 

CM: Who are you? This little girl told me her mother wasn't here.

ME: Her mother isn't here, I'm her aunt.

Apparently CM asked my niece if her parents were there and my niece being 5 said that they weren't. So CM thought she was alone. She was also blocking my niece from coming to me when I called her over. 

CM: How do I know that? You could be anyone. 

ME: But she just called me by name. That is my niece and you need to let her go. 

CM: You don't look like a mother. I won't let a child run to just anyone.

ME: If you don't let her go right now, I will press charges. She's terrified! 

And she was, my niece was crying and trying to get to me. And this woman had her by the arm in a death grip. I was pissed and scared for her cause she doesn't know what's happening.

I was trying to calm my niece down, and told her that everything was going to be okay while also trying to get this woman off my niece. I was very close to just knocking this woman out. But at this point I am already on the phone with the police with my free hand and have given them her plate number and where we were.

After a lot of back and forth the police arrive.

PD: What is going on here?

CW: This lady is trying to take this girl!

ME: That is my niece and she is trying to get her into her van. I don't know who the fuck this woman is! 

PD: If you are her aunt, can you corroborate that? I need some proof that you are who you say you are.

ME: I have a ton of pictures on my phone of us hanging out. Will that prove it? 

I proceed to show him a bunch of pictures of us at the park, ice cream shop, christmas pictures, ect. And I give him my brothers number to call. Which he did call and asked my brother to come down to provide a statement. 

After an hour we are able to leave. The officer asked if my brother wanted to press charges and he did. 

The CW threw a huge fit as we were leaving and saying that it wasn't right for us to leave and that she wasn't wrong for trying to take a child."

When we were leaving Galaxy's edge, I thought I saw someone dressed as Padma and thought they were a character.  I went up to some of the employees and asked who that was and they had no idea.  This lady was getting her pictures taken and I just watched what was happening for awhile and a few things struck me as odd.  The person who I thought was dressed as Padme was talking to the photographer like a regular person and not how Padme would act because Disney characters aren't supposed to break character, EVER.  If you're dressed as Mickey mouse and you're getting sick for you have to signal that you got to get out of the costume and if you barf then well you have to barf in the head because you can't take it off.  It wasn't until my dad pointed out the person was wearing sneakers that it finally clicked that this was just some model and not a character at the park.  Glad I didn't go up and say anything to them.  Seriously, if you're gonna dress up like one of the Disney characters for a photoshoot or just to cosplay at Disneyland or one of the Disney parks here's some advice.  Don't.  Just don't.  I have no idea why this person was dressed up like Padme, whether they were modelling a Star wars theme dress or something for a magazine I really do hope that they try to make an effort to say ""This isn't a Disney character, please move along we're doing a photoshoot"" because there was no clear way to tell.  I really hope that no one bothered them.  Seriously, DO NOT COSPLAY AT DISNEYLAND.  It's a REALLY bad idea."

I’m new and I wanted to share my past experiences with me and my mom.

Me: MEME LORD.

Mom: main protagonist (anime~)

EL: entitled lady

PB:POLICE BOIZ

Now here’s a little backstory my mom which works at a totally different store in Madison literally still has her uniform from the whole other business because she had to get me from school. We decided to get some shoes because I was growing out of some and that’s how we got to the to the shoe shop, we were at this really old shoe shop in 2016
I was shopping with my mom buying some shoes, in the store was about to close. When we bought our shoes and got them they were literally closed right when we got out this lady got out of the car mind you when we were walking away she walked straight up to the door trying to get in, then walked up to my mom. 

My mom remembers the rest so this is her point of the story) she said EL:”umm can you unlock the door?” 
She said it in the most polite way. My mom said “I’m sorry I don’t work here, they closed and now excuse m-“ EL interrupts her “DON’T THINK YOU CAN LIE TO ME!” My mom said she looked like a angry bull. My mom said “ chill, it’s just closed till tomorrow just go here the next da-“ EL: “NO I NEED SOME HEELS FOR MYSELF AND MY CHILD PLUS YOU WORK HERE LOOK AT YOUR OUTFIT YOU BITCH!”

She notices the bags I have fill with the shoe boxes, she tries to snatch them away from me,my mom grabs the bags and tells me to call 911 and throws me her purse I call them.
my mom is great friends with police, especially some so the girls who work there and the EL punches my mom in the face while I’m calling them literally it’s like the tom and jerry show where mouse runs away from the cat and the mouse is being beaten, when they arrive my mom is beat up and when the EL finds out the police have been called she runs away people are asking my mom and me questions and I barely know what’s going on so I just say “please don’t arrest me!” while crying over and over again :p

We sued her and we heard that she moved away saying in here car to here neighbors “FUCK ALL OF YOU” she’s been gone now Community service and when the police found drugs in her house because of the crimes she committed she was in prison for years and her child was abused to wear dresses and raped from her mom posted her on a sex website She is now with nice Family members my mom’s friends police contacted us to tell us all of this information and she may get a death sentence with all this other stuff on her plate, that’s it folks."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cuhag7/oh_crap_my_grip_slipped_m/,"Oh crap my grip slipped [M] Long time lurker who has enjoyed reading but just had this happen to me a couple weeks ago and, now that legalities got cleared up, knew I needed to share.

Some background, I'm in my 40 and former military/army.  I now work with adults, 18+ with mental or physical disabilities.  One of the common parts of my job is escorting clients to the gym who want to workout and try to keep their weight down, a big problem for far to many.  In some cases i just need to be there while in other cases I need to be within arms reach of the client at all times just in case.  The company I work with has a contract for gym use with a local hospital with a positive health program so almost anyone can get a membership at their gym and get help monitoring weight, or whatever.  Like a lot of big time gyms.  From this point on the story unfolds quickly.

On the day in question I was there with 2 clients, 1 who is independent and the other whom I have to stay within 5-10 feet of.  We were lifting free weights and I was changing the weights over for his lighter load as Karen approaches.  now, I am in black shorts, standard for gym staff and am wearing an old grey army T-shirt with ARMY across the front in big black letters.  Standard issues army pt shirt.  The staff wears grey shirts but theirs has the hospitals bright, colorful logo over the heart.  Nothing else.  As I said, this unfolded quickly.

Karen comes storming up to me: excuse me I have an appointment and you need to find my trainer.

Me:  Sorry miss, i don't work here.

K:  Don't give me that crap you are clearly helping him.

Me:  Yes miss, I am his personal staff from another company.  We're merely utilizing a membership here, just like you.

K:  Don't give me that s---  (at this point my client started making a noise he makes when he is getting frustrated or scared and her rising voice could easily do that to him so I turned my head to look at and talk to him) DON'T YOU IGNORE ME!  ""POW""  She actually slapped me in the face, catching me in the nose as I had turned to look at my client and hard enough to snap my face around to be looking in almost the opposite direction (from looking over my right shoulder to almost looking over my left).

Important point here, I had been holding a 45 pound weight in front of me in both hands and with the shock of the slap, yep, as per the title, my grip slipped.  There was no bouncy ""boing"" of a weight dropped on the rubber floor mats either, just a sickening crunch.  I didn't feel anything, which worried me until I saw the look of not being able to breath on her face.  It had landed just across the base of her toes on top of her bright, sparkly, polished gym shoes.

My guy starts laughing his butt off.  I move him aside leaving her there and call for a nurse, that there had been an accident but it was not needed, there were a good half dozen medical staff including 2 doctors in the gym at the same time so I just walked my guy away to minimize his stimulous and let them handle it.

Keeping it short, several bones in her foot were broken, she wanted me fired and then when learning I did not in fact work there wanted to sue me and the hospital/gym.  I did indeed file chargers for assault and she not only lost grounds for her lawsuit but lost her membership because she assaulted another client and got handed a hefty hospital bill for her foot.

Hope you all enjoyed.  I'm just glad to be in the clear and that there were so many witnesses.  (My guy still retells this story every chance he gets.)"

Yesterday I visited the red bullseye store. You know the one. Yeah, the one with red shirts and no Captain Kirk.

I turn around half expecting a Karen, but to my shock and dismay it wasn’t a Karen. In fact, it was as if the entire situation was at the end of a good story.

There, standing with arms folded, was a manager scowling at me.

“Excuse me! If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.” He sounded serious.

“Isn’t that a quote from that Mcdonalds movie?” I was serious. I think Nick Offermans character said it, but I’m not certain.

Customer used deflect. It was somewhat effective.

“Probably, but I don’t want you standing around doing nothing. We don’t play you to hang out.” His time was less harsh, but still stern.

“Your not paying me anything. I’m a customer.” I gestured down and realized I had made a serious fashion mistake. I was in a red polo and khakis.... 

He eyed me up and down and shook his head. It was apparent the situation was as awkward for him as it was for me as he said “ Oh... I uhm... I’m sorry sir. I just saw a uniform standing around and half expected you to be (redacted name). He’s new and a lazy shit. I really am sorry about bothering you.”

“It’s alright. I should have realized what I was wearing today.”

During that time, the cell companies allowed you to choose a custom number from a block of numbers if you so desired. I chose an easy number. XXX-0555. 

I dont get that many calls these recent years as texting and DM are the best way to contact me. Any number I dont recognize, I let go to voicemail. Which the message says, ""Hi, as you've gotten this far and haven't realized I never listen to Voice Mails, I'll assume your selling something. Not interested. KTHKSBYE"" 

One afternoon I check my phone after my work shift and notice 50+ missed calls. All from various numbers I didnt know. I was very confused but honestly didnt think much of it other than I would have a talk with my Mom.  She had previously given out my number when she was trying to sell something on craigslist and I thought that this was another instance.  

My phone rang again while I was out in the parkinglot so I answered it even thought I didnt know the number.

Me: ""...uh yes? But this is not [LRC]""  
BH: ""in the ad, this number is listed as the store contact?""  
I was very confused by this point but I quickly pieced things together.  
Me: ""Sounds like the company listed the wrong number then. I'm not [LCR]. You dialed my number""  
BH: ""ok? I dont understand, I've called [LRC] that's off Main Street for years. Did they change their number?""  
Me: ""I've had this number for 22 years. Some idiot at the ad agency fast-fingered the phone number and listed mine instead. Do you understand that?""  
BH: ""So.. is [LRC] out of business? Close down?""  
Obviously tried of this conversation.  
Me: ""Yes, they are closed, go to another store to get your cooler""   <click> 


Aftermath: I called up [LRC] and evetually spoke to the general manager. He was very cool and understanding with the situation and gave me $50 in store credit for my troubles.  Apparently the ad agency put the 777-xxx-0555 area code as my 555-xxx-0555 area code. I never saw the ad but the phone calls all but stopped within a few days.  
No idea of Bargin Hunter ever got his cooler. He was obviously clueless enough not to listen to me, maybe he didnt hear my final statement."

Some context:
I’m 16, and I don’t currently work anywhere as I draw commissions. I ALWAYS carry my sketchbook with me (this will be important later on), and it’s fairly full at the moment. 

Now, onto the harassment

I’d recently gotten my mom’s old car (she had a new one now, this was worked out previously) and decided to go for a grocery run, mainly because my mom is off at my grandparents house because of some irl reasons. I get the list from my dad, and everything seems great! Everyone is super nice, and this particular grocery store just got remodeled, so I was having trouble finding somethings, but not too bad.

The staff at the grocery store wear a blue polo, black pants, and sometimes a blue apron with the store name embroidered on it. I was wearing a blue T-Shirt, and some very comfy black leggings, and this was just a normal outfit for me, as it helps to keep me comfy but not hot.

I was getting some eggs when I hear a loud “Excuse me?” from behind me. I turn around. “Hello?” I ask, wanting to be polite and not be rude.

Me: Willow, King of Thorns 
K: The Wild Karen
OE: Other Employee, who’d helped me earlier and was very nice :)

K: Excuse me, I need help finding [item a], [item b] and [item c].

Me: Oh, I’m sorry ma’am! I don’t work here, there’s an employee over there though! *I point at OE, who walks over.*

OE: Hello ma’am, how can I help you today?

It’s important to mention that at this point, I have my sketchbook in my cart. It’s my son, thank you very much. 

K: Why won’t she help me? *points at me*

Me: I don’t work here, I’m here to buy groceries.

K: No, you OBVIOUSLY have on the uniform! You work here. *she stalks towards me. Y’all, I ain’t kidding when I say stalked.*

Me: I don’t work here, like I’ve told you. My shirt doesn’t have {Grocery Store} embroidered on it.

K: *is at my cart, and snatches my sketchbook* Well, I’m taking this for compensation for my time wasted!

OE: Ma’am, you cant do that. That’s theft of property.

I’m fuming.

K: I’ll give it back once I see your manager!

Me: I don’t work here! How else do I say it!

OE: I’ll get the store manager if you give her back her sketchbook.

K: FINE! 

She slams my sketch book into my cart, and bends one of the corners permanently. I glare at her, and walk off. 

That’s the end of this experience. I don’t want to go to the grocery store alone again."

Me:,, Yeah ok. I DO work here but not atm."" 
C:,, But I saw you talk to your co worker so you are not on a break.""
Me:,, Yeah well, I've been in vocational school the past weeks, I am just here as a regular customer today.""
C:,,This sounds like an cheap excuse! What kind of Customer service is this?! ""
Me:,, Excuse me. I do work here but not today and not at the moment. I do not wear a Uniform as you can see, today I am a regular Customer and if you need someone at the Carpets I can get you one of my Coworkers."" 
C:,, why can't you make it by yourself? I mean you do work here?!"" 
Me:,, Yeah but today I am not working.""
C:,,But you still could do it for us."" 
Me:,, I am a Customer myself today, I am afraid I can not.""
C:,,I do not understand this. Why does it not get to you?! I. Need. A. Carpet. You do work here and know how to cut this sh.. Stuff. Why you still not cutting the Carpet for us? ""

Me:,, Because today I am not at work here but as a Customer. And Customers are not allowed to cut the Carpet by themselfes and I would get in trouble if I just cut the Carpet even if I do not work today."" 

C:,, But you know how to do it so why would you get in trouble? Why not just cut it now?!"" 

By this time my Coworker stands behind the Customer and explains what I have been explaining the whole time. 
Coworker:,, Because she does not work today. She is here as an Customer and Customers are not allowed to cut the Carpet. And Coworkers who have a day off but come here to shop are as much a customer than you are. If you actually go shopping in the place you actually work at, would you serve a Customer in your free time? ""

C:,, No! Of course not I am here to sho.. Oh."" 
They not even apologized but also they kind of didn't want any carpet anymore also.. they just turned around and left. 
I don't know if they were embarrased by themselfes or insulted. But this is still one of the weirdest stories that happend to me.."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cu81zm/helping_out/,"helping out not sure if this belongs here but figured it would be a good read.

one day my Fiance and i when shopping for some clothes for her and be not wanting to pressure her I when to the electronics section being a huge nerd. shortly i was approached by some lady and she started asking about suggestions about headsets for her son. me being bored proceed to help her pick out a nice set for her young teen son. she then asked me if i could get one out of the case for her quickly that she thought i worked there i proceeded to correct her and inform her that I'm just a customer. she laughs thanks me. when she returns I'm still there (my now ex still shopping) and the employee asks which one. when he sees it he proceeds to tell her that one is junk she asks why he thinks so and he just replies it is the old model. she then laughs at him and asks for the product and she thanks me for being better at the guy's job than he is."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/ctnxtf/im_not_a_doctor_but_i_was_an_amateur_gynecologist/,"I'm NOT a doctor, but I was an amateur gynecologist in high school TL:DR  Take 730 aspirin and call me next year, you're calling the wrong #.

We owned a 24/7 business and I often worked over nights.  I was also the emergency on call person.  On nights I didn't work, sleep was worth more than gold.  I had, and still have, the most F'd up sleep patterns and catch extra ZZZZZZZ's whenever I can.  I sleep very sound and deep.  In fact, about the only thing that  wakes my is my alarm and my phone ringing.  This was a great skill to have when my kids were younger as I often had to sleep when they we up and active.

Cue my problem and temper.   

I would get calls from a doctor's answering service asking for the doctor.  When the calls first started, I would tell them I wasn't the doctor.   More than once I got a return call almost immediately from the same person who told me that ""this is the doctor's home number"".  No it's not, it's my number.   ""OK, I'll page him"".

After the first couple months, I started telling the service to tell the people to ""take 730 aspirin and call back next year"".   They then knew I wasn't the doctor and we'd have the annoying, ""you called the wrong number again"" talk.   Now, the more they called the more outrageous my cures got.  FYI- masturbation and self intercourse cures most illnesses, as per me.

After almost 3 years of this annoying crap, I got a true emergency call from them that the doctor had to call \*\*\*\*\* ER because one of his patients came in suffering a heart attack.  He was taking meds and other issues and they needed to confer with him about the appointment he had with the patient the day before.

I hung up and called the ER myself.  I got the doctor that needed to talk to the real doctor on the phone and told him:

1) I am not the doctor and have had his answering service calling me about 3 years.

2) I have told them numerous times but they never fixed the problem

3) this is the first life threatening emergency they called with and I thought the best way to handle it was to call HIM and let him see if the hospital knew how to really get in contact with their colleague.

I told him I understood this was a matter of life and death and I would not take anymore of his time.  I ended by giving him my number so he could compare it to the correct number to possibly check where the problem occurred, so it did not happen again.  All this took less than a minutes as I started the conversation with, ""please just listen"".

The doctor I was getting calls for was a PCP, primary care physician, a family doctor, not a cardiologist or brain surgeon.  The calls I was getting for him were things like ""little Johnny has a fever of 100.1, what should we do""  ""can you refill my meds"", things like that.

I know I struck a nerve with the ER doctor because I NEVER got another call from the doctor's answering service again.  I hope the guy that had a heart attack is OK and I thank for getting my situation fixed."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cu0mja/almost_almost/,"Almost ... Almost ... I thought I was going to have an Idontworkhere story yesterday when my 14 year old daughter and I were shopping at our supermarket. An older woman, who did not speak our language, or did with a very heavy accent, came up to her and asked her a question. My daughter looked confused and I was getting ready to utter the famous words when I realized what the woman was trying to find out. 

I grew up in an Italian NYC neighborhood at a time when some of the first generation were still around so I could make out what the woman was asking better than my daughter. Turns out she just wanted to know where the hair goods were (my daughter has long curly hair) when she gestured to my daughter's head and I realized she was saying 'perm' with an Italian accent. Since we were in the last aisle I just pointed to the rest of the store and said that a way (I knew where it was but couldn't remember the aisle number). She thanked me, we parted ways and we finished our stopping. 

Maybe next time."
IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/ctskow/wannabe_tough_guy_gets_owned/,"Wannabe tough guy gets owned This happened to me about four years ago, and it’s something I still kinda laugh about to this day, as bittersweet as it is.

Here’s some background, I was in the market for a new portable DVD player with an hdmi input, I had been to well over 8 places, all of which I had called in advance, and was pretty much lied to over the phone, so I was having a really bad day. I was successful in getting what I needed, but I was still annoyed at what I had gone through in some of the previous places, so I wasn’t in the mood to deal with any bs from anyone. Now, I’m an easy going guy, and normally not the type to get confrontational, and even when I have a short fuse because of a bad day, I try to keep it to myself. However, when push comes to shove, I don’t take crap from anybody, especially if someone decides to get physical. Also, sorry for the long winded backstory, but it does put some perspective in some of the actions I believe that I needed to take.

Anyways, on to the story: 

After a bad day, I stopped at the local Walmart( this Walmart location is in a bad area) in order to pick up a few things, at the time, I’m warring a punisher T-shirt, a black baseball cap, a pair of dark blue jeans, and a pair of steel toe combat boots,( although, they look like regular shoes with the pant legs covering the tops) the employee uniforms are blue polo shirt, khaki or black pants, and a blue vest with the company logo. So I’m over in the auto section, picking up an oil filter and oil for my truck, when somebody asked me for help. He wanted to know what kind of oil and oil filter he needed to do an oil change. I told him what he needed to know as far as what oil filter as well as oil( he drove the same make, model, year and engine size as I do). I also told him that I didn’t work there, but knew exactly what he needed, because I was doing the same thing. He apologized for disturbing me, and thanked me for the help, I told him it wasn’t a problem, DIY guys like us need to look out for each other. He thanked me again, and went on his way. After I had finished getting the oil I needed, I went looking for spark plugs. At this point, I’m trying to find the right ones that I need. Que the wannabe tough guy. Here’s the context: gd= me, wtg= wannabe tough guy, emp= employee, s = supervisor.

Wtg: hey you lazy jackass, you need to help me, I have been waiting for 15 minutes to get some spark plugs for my car, a 1999 Mazda Miata, now do your job 

Gd: (annoyed) look, I don’t work here, so I can’t help you

Wtg: what do you mean you don’t work here, you where helping that other guy get an oil filter and oil for his truck, so why can’t you get your shit together and help me

Gd: first of all, that guy I helped, was polite and respectful, second, he drives the same type of truck as I do, so I know the parts he needed, 3rd, I don’t know Jack about what YOU need for your car, and last, I don’t work here, now leave me alone.

Wtg: are you fucking kidding me right now, here’s what’s gonna happen, your gonna get me my spark plugs, and show me some respect, or I’m gonna beat some respect in to you( mind you this guy is about 5foot 8, and looks like he weighs 115lbs soaking wet, I am 5foot 10, and weight 229lbs)

Gd:(at this point, I start to get loud) first of all, don’t you ever threaten me like that, unless you want a first hand experience of what the inside of an ambulance looks like, and second, I. Don’t. Work. Here. Now do me and yourself a favor, and FUCK OFF( I’m also visibly angry at this point)

At this time a female employee as well as a supervisor hear the commotion and came to see what was going on

S:( standing with employee) hello, umm, what seems to be the issue here?

Wtg: this stupid mother fucker refused to help me, so fire his stupid ass before I beat some respect in to this asshole. 

S: Well, I can’t fire him, he doesn’t work here, so please stop threatening this customer, and tone down your language, she will look up what you need for your vehicle, ok

Wtg: whatever, just get me my spark plugs 

Gd: (talking to s) I need some help too, I’m looking for xx part, it’s not here on the peg, would you know if you guys have any more in the back

S: yeah, not a problem, I’ll check as soon as my employee is done with this “gentleman”

Gd: ok, I can wait.

Wtg:( getting impatient with emp) what the fuck is taking so long, you too stupid to figure out how to work that thing?

Emp: sir, this machine is rather old, and it takes some time for it to process the information that’s

Wtg:(cuts emp off, then shoves her, causing her to fall to the ground) get the fuck out of my way you retarded ass bitch(s is standing there in shock at what he just witnessed)

Gd:(I’m damn near seeing red at this point) what is your problem man, didn’t your mother raise you to not put your hands on a woman like that!?

Wtg: you know what, FUCK YOU![wtg takes a swing at me with a straight right punch( at the time, I was a good 3 years in to martial arts, including Brazilian jiu jitsu, tae kwon do, muay thai, and boxing) I dodge the incoming right with a slip cross to an outside leg sweep, taking him down, and from there while holding his right arm, I rolled him on to his stomach, i still had his arm in a good position, while I had my left shin in top of his back, just below his neck) 

Gd:( talking to s while still having wtg pinned) hey, snap out of it and call the police 

First s got on his radio, talked to someone on the other end, then he called the police. I takes the police about 5 minutes to get there. Cops takes our statements, while wtg and I are in cuffs, one officer is in a room with emp, and s, about 5 to 7 minutes later, all three come out of the office, after that, I was uncuffed, got an apology from the officer, and asked if I wanted to press charges. I said I did, and wtg was hulled off to jail, from what the officer told me, wtg was getting charged with 2 counts of aggravated battery, 1 count for me, 1 count for pushing emp, 1 count attempted shoplifting, criminal trespass, and disorderly conduct. S did eventually got me the parts I needed, and discounted my entire purchase.

I did apologize to s and emp afterworlds about what had happened, both said it was unnecessary, I thanked them both, paid for my items, and left.
